# Planets of the Itavrnai System

- Itavrnai I is a rocky, uninhabitable planet too close to the sun. 
- **[[Wyrmveld]]** (Itavrnai II) is the semi-arid home of the Wyrmfolk, known for its mountaious desert, and dual moons. 
- **[[Esmërældus]]** (Itavrnai III), the lush forested home of the Ælffolk, is known for its tree cites, unique wildlife, and wyld magick. 
- **[[Kunatairō]]** (Itavrnai IV), home of the Vulpfolk, is an archipelagic planet 90% covered in water. It is known for its beaches, deep blue seas, and for naturally having an atmospheric composition that acts as a potent aphrodisiac and stimulant. 
- [[Itavrnai V]] is considered a holy planet of the Pentarchal Species, and is home to multiple holy sites. Access to the planet is strictly forbidden outside those invited. This is enforced with an automated planetary defence matrix.
- **[[Syndïlæ]]** (Itavrnai VI) is the home of the Wülffolk, and the Felidfolk, it is a cold planet, known for its tundras, blizzards, and natural underground cave networks.
- Itavrnai VII is an icy planet with a thin atmosphere that, while terraformable in theory, is too cold to do so in practice.
## Extra Data
- Itavrnai is an F8V-type star, ~1.2x larger and ~320K hotter than our own sun. The system has 7 planets, 5 of which reside within the habitable zone. 
- Itavrnai I is a mineral-poor rocky planet 1.01x size of Mercury. It has no natural satellites.
- Itavrnai II is an hot, arid planet 1.31x the size of Earth with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It has one natural satellite, Itavr IIa, a mineral-rich rock 0.87x the size of earth's moon.

- Itavrnai VIII is a frozen planet 1.23x the size of Mars. It has two natural satellites.

## Itavrnai II 
The planet of **Itavrnai II** is home to two supercontinents, the larger _[[Dirakatōna]]_, and the smaller _[Vikatorūa]]_. _Dirakatōna_ is the birthplace of _the Wyrmfolk_ and dominates the planet with roughly 70% of land area and 40% of total surface area, while _Vikatorūa_ is around 27% of total land area, with _the Liranota archipelago_ being a nature preserve. The two supercontinents are separated distantly by open ocean. _Vikatorūa_ is home to the **[[Vyktorian Commonwealth]]**, an autonomous nation within the greater **Itavran Union** which is permanently managed by the Union as a refuge for the victims of the **[[Atosian Exodus]]**, after the fall of multiple **Stellar Entente** colonies within the _Atos_ system. Vyktory is permanently stuck in a slow technological crawl to match the modern day conditions on the planet of _[[Sol III]]_.

## Itavrnai V
Itavrnai V is home to five intersex goddesses, each representing the prototypical "Eve" of their species. The single "Adam" that impregnated them all is represented by a sixth species, one which was unknown by the Itavr until they made contact with Earth in the year 1996, specifically the 31th of March. At 3:13am Melbourne time, the [[IUSS Dragon's Maw]] warped into orbit of Sol IX (Pluto) by accident, as a male born at the William Angliss Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. This baby was the reincarnation of the "Adam" which created the [[Pentarchal Species]] Eventually this child was granted passage to and from the main temple on Itavrnai V, named **[[Origin Hall]]**. That child, born as [[Jeremy Ritter]], went on to become a transgender socialist, human rights activist, and multimedia content creator known as [[Luna Darke]]. Eventually, her consciousness was transferred into a more immortal body, able to shapeshift into any of the Pentarchal Species as well as her human self. In this form, she took on the form of ancient Wyrmfolk goddess [[Nexxus Drako]], and wound up merging into the ASI of the same name.

# Earth Stuff
Initially Sol III _(originally known to Itavrans as "Kuratazi III")_ was seen as a possible colony, however when they discovered humanity in its Paleolithic Age, they decided to passively interfere and gild the species while observing from a starbase in the Oort Cloud. Earth has been in Itavran space for millennia at this point, and the Itavran have been passively guiding humanity as they wish. Japanese is closely related to the Itavran language, as the Japanese deities were descended from Itavrans. [[Itavran]] is usually written in Katakana and is entirely mutually unintelligible with Japanese, and appears much like Arabic does to Urdu speakers, which is as gibberish written in the same script. All deities on Earth are all interpretations of living gods in Itavrnai.

# Culture
The most popular show on Itavrnai is the soap opera _**[[ISS Voyager]]**_, loosely reminiscent of _Star Trek_. The most popular non-Sports show imported from Sol III is Australia's ***Neighbours.***

In the Union, when speaking English, the Felidfolk sound South African, the Wülffolk sound like a Scandinavian who speaks EN as a 2nd language, the Ælffolk have a received pronunciation accent reminiscent of BBC newscasters, and the Kitsunes, depending on which tribe they're from, can have any accent, whether it be Texan, New Englander, Californian, Scot, Cockney, Mancunian, Novacastrian, the various Australian accents, et cetera. Wyrmfolk accents are majority General Australian, with the more rural areas picking up more of a Broad Australian accent.

# Religion
The [[Avatar of the Creator]] is a belief that the creator of the Itavrnai system at any one time has a single living person in the universe as their avatar to act on their behalf.
The goddess of time, who does the stitching, is an elder dragoness by the name of **[[Vyvræl]]**. Her other demesnes are the cosmos itself, alongside the concept of narrative/storytelling. She is older than even the multiverse itself. They say those who have seen her avatars have usually been people of extreme importance to the multiverse. Very rare though, and mostly unheard of.
The _**Wyrmfolk**_ _goddess of victory_ (both in battle and in other contests), is the _golden dragon_ **[[Galzra]]**.
## Schooling
There are 20 years of mandatory public schooling in the Itavran Union education system. Please note that public schooling in the Itavran Union is heavily based on the Montessori education system on Earth. This is also balanced by reminding everyone that most Itavran species live fore upwards of 120 years on average.

# Species
Wyrmfolk have a low natural birth rate, but a very high birth rate via in-vitro fertilisation. Ergo, most of their babies are "designer babies". This is helped by the fact they have no external genitalia until they undergo the cultural coming of age ceremony, which involves hibernating in a special cell for 12 months, allowing their mind, soul, and body to change their appearance (and sexual organs) to whatever they deeply, internally wish to be. This process is also voluntarily undertaken by adults who have had experiences that change their chosen sex and gender. 

Wyrmfolk aren't perfect. They've got many skeletons in their closet from their early space age. 
The Wyrmfolk are a species of wingless draconic humanoids. They are a warrior species that eventually unified after they discovered other planets had life, and are the major species in the Union. They rule with a velvet glove, but arms ready to put on the iron fist when needed. Their physical strength outweighs their minds, which are on par with the average human. Their culture values polyamorous relationships and is considered extremely open about sexuality and such. They are born without genitalia and undergo a ritual metamorphosis at the age of majority, in which their sexual organs are changed to match their desired sex. Gender is considered to be a spectrum, with a very loose binary occuring with their pronouns. Itavr II is an arid planet, with scarce water. Most of the water consumed on the planet is made with machines which combine hydrogen and oxygen from the air and space. The capital is the city of **[[Kitani]]**, a large megalopolis brimming across most of it's continent.

Ælffolk have a very low birth rate, but live to be at least 1,000, so elf chldren are extremely rare, especially as they're considered "Adults" by age 23. There are also many more females than males (80/20) split, which also makes all males have a royal importance, and many ælven women work and live in a male's harem. Lineage amongst Ælffolk is extremely important, poltically, and ælven women often compete to be part of a harem, if they so wish to be. The most famous "paternal house" is of course, [[House Rythorn]], whose current patriarch is **[[Sevestra Rythorn]]**, who was the first intersex Ælffolk to be born with both reproductive systems functional. 

Wulffolk and Felidfolk have normal birth rates, but only have a mating season every 7 years. Multiple births are common and expected.

Kitsunes have an extremely low birthrate, extremely high miscarriage rate, and make up for this by having extreme libidos. To the extent that their mandatory schooling ends after Junior High, as sexual maturity at 15 basicallky requires them to stop schooling and breed. The entire society of the kitsunes is focussed on breeding with the others in their den. A breeding den consists of a queen, three princes to breed said queen, seven maids to service the queen and princes, and twenty-one drones to breed each other. Any extra kitsunes are residents and workers, and usually are free to do as they wish. Many go to other planets to become sex workers on their own initiative. The kitsunes are actually artificially limited by the Wyrmfolk due to previous overpopulation on their archipelagic planet. The history between the two is quite sordid, actually.

# Vyktoryan Commonwealth
The Vyktorian Commonwealth is an autonomous region of the Itavran Union located on the continent of _Vikatorūa_ on the planet of Itavrnai II, home of the Wyrmfolk.

The flag has a 1:2 aspect ratio. It is divided into two background trapezoids with a central triangular element. The maroon trapezoid occupies the left side, and the yellow trapezoid occupies the right side. A white triangle, outlined in black, is positioned so that its apex sits 31.3% of the way along the flag’s length. The triangle’s interior angle at the apex measures 31.3 degrees. The triangle is treated as the primary element, with the trapezoids functioning as background fields.

The maroon stands for the blood of the people, the yellow stands for the sun that gives us life, the white stands for her holiness' divine light, and the black V stands for the confluent victory of all three.

# History

# Three Sisters of Tikal
**[[Tikal]]** is the name of a star nearby to Itavrnai, but it's named after the ancient **[[Queendom of Tikal]]**, who were based on the _Vikatorūa_ landmass of Itavrnai II which is now home to the Vyktorian Commonwealth, and the somewhat familiar [[Vyktan]] species (basically humans, but with more outlandish natural hair, eye, and skin colors). This was key during the Three Sisters period, where Tikal was divided amongst the triplet daughters of Queen Solana IV; Faelira, Caelestia, and Erista, becoming fractured as the three sisters try to reconcile things under a single regent, their uncle, Excelcius Darikan. It was never noted which child came first as they're all identical triplets. The Queendom of Tikal practiced female-preference primogeniture. 

Wyrmfolk are in a particularly imperial era of their ascendancy at this time and decided to seed a new (humanish) lifeform on one of their minor continents, and cut them off from all contact in or out, while monitoring them with technology that seems to the locals like magic. At some point said "magick" begins to go haywire and cause massive problems for the mediaeval serf-based society, eventually, an Avatar of the Creator battles through a (formerly cloaked) Wyrmish base at the end where the exposition of the whole situation happens. Then the avatar decides to reveal all, before dying as the Wyrmfolk activates their nuclear option and glasses the continent from orbit.

## The Immortal Six
- The Leader of Itavrnai II, and the Wyrmfolk, is Nexxus Drako, a being given immortality by ascending themselves to ASI. 
- The Leader of Itavrnai III, and the Ælffoll, is [[Sythini Rythorn]], who has ascended to immortality via extreme genetic engineering and cloning ability. 
- The Leader of Itavrnai IV, the leader of the Vulpfolk, is [[Kazumi Aikawa]], who ascended to immortality by self sterilization and extreme hormonal manipulation along with gene therapy. 
- The dual Leaders of Itavrnai VI, the leaders of the Wolffolk ([[Luna Fenrir]]) and Felidolk ([[Quinn Caelestis]]) both became immortal through intense ritual and manipulation of the forces of the universe, and of each other. 
- The Leader of Itavrnai V, and goddess-creator of the entire Itavran Union, is Luna Darke, the Avatar of the Creator.

## racism
scale color has some societal impact in wyrmfolk, as does fur color in kitsune, wulf, and felid societies, even if most of it is eradicated.
black-scaled wyrmfolk are still relatively disadvantaged, and you can blame æsterath drækonis for that
the war of the twin brothers still has a lot of intergenerational trauma
galzra (a white-scaled wyrmfolk) won, and did rewrite a lot of history
it is from galzra and his wife miremel (red) that the eventual goddess and ASI Nexxus Drako was born
nexxus' main project as of late is revealing that history and trying to make amends with æsterath's family, as nexxus feels the war was unjust
(note that nexxus is functionally immortal as she became the AI that runs most of the itavran union, due to the fact that AI was required to be paired with a "paragon" to experience the world through their eyes, similar to mass effect andromeda)

## tectonics
i've been thinking of making at least one of the five itavran planets stangant-lid (probably V, given its nature as a holy site)
i know for sure II is tectonically active (it's currently in a pangaea-like phase with a secondary continent in the vast ocean where Vyktory is/was)
III, IV, and VI I'm yet to figure out, though I'm sure IV being an archipelagic world with islands forming often also precludes it from being non-tectonically active
VI with it's massive mountain ranges and icy-status has got to be tectonic
III is stagnant-lid then, very boreal and swampy yet still kinda unstable
III being stagnant-lid also makes sense for the Ælffolk with their permanence and long-livedness probably stemming from the fact life cycles on their world are just... longer in general

# ælven birth
Things just move slower over there, hence why Ælffolk are famously lax about time and punctuality, which is a sticking point for the overly-efficient and punctual Wyrmfolk.
ælfolk live for about 1000 years at natural minimum, the longest has lived 1900~ and the average is 1300~ and ælves usually only have 2-3 children in total per female. very slow, but above replacement at least.
usually it's one pair of twins and that's it given the ælffolk have a high proclivity to twins and triplets, even if they have way fewer births, but they can only really conceive once, as the birthing process leaves the womb unable to foster life afterwards... that's mainly because ælfolk don't have a menstrual cycle... ælffolk can spin their reproductive system up once, then it no longer works.

# self awareness
I think my issue is the inability to untangle my world from me. My world started off as an imagination-based escapist thing, and I'm trying to make myself less of an active god and more of a passive avatar within said world. It's why I'm trying to make the Wyrmfolk slightly more antagonistic, make the Kitsunes everyone's sex worker, sorta kinda like this cross between the clean cyberprep and the hard cyberpunk, I would definitely say the Itavran Union has this mix between Commonwealthist modernism, Cyberpunk aesthetic and Soviet utilitarianism all wrapped in a spacefaring package.

# dystopia
i understand itavrnai is becoming more and more dystopian i'm trying to balance it to a more grounded and realistic extrapolation of a researcher species (the wyrmfolk) and meeting a breeder species (kitsunes/vulpfolk), a hedonist species one planet over (ælffolk), and two competing warrior species on the same planet on the opposite side of the system that nearly nuked itself (wulffolk and felidfolk) and the interactions with each

# jarokn
I still can't believe it's been twenty fucking years since my main OC Nexxus Drako was created. Funfact: Nexxus was originally silver (with blue streaks) in their beta form. Why? Pokemon the Movie 2000, and Lugia.
Yes, that means I came up with Nexxus Drako at age 9.
Nexxus isn't my first character, her brother Draco is. He was invented at age 5 (that's 2001 for you btw) Draco is the only OC, alter, and fursona not to transition with the rest of our system. Mainly because his gender is closer to void than it is masculine. Draco is a stylized depiction of my darkness, my depression, my intrustive thoughts. And the fact I had that sort of fucking experience at age 5... because Draco was the anger, the rage, the prosecutor. He was the first alter. Protecting me from the abuse and shit, I guess. Also Nexxus Drako is not her "official name". Draco Umbra Drakonius and Nexxus Jarokn Drakonius are the names of the twin siblings. Hence why she shortens to Drako. She isn't on the best terms with her brother. As for the name [[Jarokn]], nowadays it's a meaningless holdover from our past, but it originally mean **JA**mes **RO**bert **KN**ight. But nowadays it's detached from the deadname. Which I wouldn't really call a deadname. It was a legal fiction, and a protective shell. I don't hate it. It was a neccessity. It's not my name though, never was. But yeah, our headspace and our world is intrinsically tied with my alters and myself, but I'm trying to write a literary version of Itavrnai that isn't pure wishfulfilment. It's hard though. Draco goes by the name Æsterath Drako now, btw.

# settlement of itavrnai v
_Five feminine beings stepped out of five cryo pods, which had been arranged in a pentagram made of conduits. All were progenitors, mothers of the Pentarchal Species. Naked as the day they were born. All of them had the same curvy body type. The five women looked at each other, and nodded with some relief. They had finally awoken._
"We've arisen. Now we rebuild what our creator could not. A system of virtue, I shall build a great library, so our subjects can learn from and store to our collective knowledge." said the Wyrmfolk progenitor, [[Scientia]].
"I shall build a great stadium to test the endurance of our subjects in great sports. So we may all grow as powerful beings." said the Wülffolk progenitor, [[Mollitiam]].
"I shall build a great clock, on a universal timescale, to teach our subjects of patience and time, and how little we have lived, and how much more we shall live, and how the universe shall outlive us." said the Ælffolk progenitor, [[Patientia]].
"I shall build a great plaza, so our subjects can meet together and learn the social studies and ways of being honest and true." said the Felidfolk progenitor, [[Inspectio]].
"I shall build a great park, so our subjects can find peace in the world and confidence in themselves and the natural spaces around them." said the Vulpfolk progenitor, [[Confidentia]].
_And so they got to work._
