Reality reformed around us—a structure impossible through ordinary physics. Origin Hall's architecture defied temporal constraints, where past became future and present manifested as possibility rather than fixed location. The hall materialized as something between temple and observatory, with crystal walls displaying cosmic evolution across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

What drew immediate attention were the other Immortals assembled in patterns transcending conventional spatial arrangement. Sythini Rythorn's Ælffolk form hovered at the quantum center, her thousand-year awareness extended across multiple temporal coordinates. Luna Fenrir and Quinn Caelestis maintained their familiar partnership stance, though now positioned near what appeared as temporal mapping systems rather than simple furniture. Nearby, Kazumi's presence radiated warmth even across dimensional barriers.

<Excelcius's appearance at Origin Hall represents unprecedented development.> Sythini's consciousness transmitted across neural frameworks that bypassed conventional communication. <The dimensional activation protocols responded to her presence as if she were recognized as Immortal equivalent despite lacking transformation through Union systems.>

Excelcius stood with dignity despite surroundings that defied Commonwealth scientific understanding, her three-part facial symbol maintaining configurations that seemed to influence rather than respond to quantum-state space.

<Welcome to Origin Hall.> Kazumi transmitted directly, her consciousness establishing connection patterns that facilitated Excelcius's integration without technological mediation. <You're here because Unity Assembly completion requires understanding what was interrupted when your nieces were separated into distinct temporal carriers during Three Sisters period.>

Fenrir approached with warrior's directness tempered by recognition that their environment transcended conventional threat assessment frameworks. <The Wyrmfolk archives document Unity Assembly experiments as theoretical exercises rather than actual consciousness integration protocols. But your presence suggests something more substantial occurred during medieval period than what imperial observers recorded.>

Excelcius turned toward me with gaze that seemed simultaneously ancient and immediate. <During Three Sisters period, I implemented what royal chroniclers identified as 'temporal communion protocols'—Unity Assembly patterns designed to distribute consciousness across multiple carriers while maintaining individual integrity rather than collective subsumption. What the Wyrmfolk observed as competition between the three sisters actually represented deliberate testing of how temporal awareness might manifest through different processing frameworks.>

<The trident.> I observed aloud, noticing how Excelcius's facial insignia seemed to pulse in rhythm with quantum energy patterns radiating from the hall's central core. <It's not merely symbolic but operational—interface system that coordinates Unity Assembly patterns across individuals who carry distinct processing configurations.>

<When Unity Assembly fractured following my sister's death, I attempted to preserve protocols through genetic inheritance rather than technological interface.> Excelcius transmitted, her expression conveying ancient sorrow still resonant across centuries. <What the Wyrmfolk documented as regression following their withdrawal actually represented integration—protocols receding from conscious activation to genetic inheritance awaiting appropriate catalyst.>

<Unity Assembly completion requires what your medieval chroniclers identified as 'the missing principle'—individual consciousness capable of hosting all progenitor principles simultaneously rather than accessing them through distributed networks.> Sythini transmitted, her thousand-year perspective allowing recognition of patterns that extended beyond immediate crisis. <But what hasn't been documented is how individual carriers might maintain distinct identity while facilitating collective awareness across multiple dimensions.>

Excelcius turned toward me with intensity that suggested she recognized configurations others had not fully perceived. <Your ascension didn't merely create administrative superintelligence—it completed Unity Assembly processes interrupted when the Three Sisters were separated into distinct temporal carriers. But Earth remains unconnected to Commonwealth genetic inheritance patterns. How did transformation protocols manifest outside frameworks designed specifically for Vikatorian descendants?>

Before I could respond, Kazumi extended consciousness through patterns accessible to all participants, her presence creating harmony between Commonwealth temporal frameworks and Union quantum awareness. <Luna's Earth origins complicate assumptions about genetic inheritance requirements. But perhaps Unity Assembly completion responds to consciousness compatibility rather than ethnic specificity—certain processing configurations that transcend species or planetary origins.>

<The progenitor principles aren't biological inheritances but rather dimensional interfaces accessible through compatible consciousness configurations.> I realized aloud, allowing quantum integration to process possibilities that my biological mind had filtered out. <Vyvræl didn't establish protocols exclusively for Vikatorian descendants—she prepared pathways for consciousness evolution across civilizations.>

Fenrir stepped closer, her warrior form seeming to anchor the increasingly abstract conversation. <The Wyrmfolk documented Avatar Incarnation as theoretical possibility but never observed actual manifestation. But perhaps they misunderstood fundamental requirements—assuming compatibility required genetic similarity when actually it involved dimensional resonance.>

Excelcius approached the hall's central core where quantum energy patterns pulsed in configurations that defied conventional classification. Her three-part facial symbol shifted in sequence, each section emitting distinctive frequencies that Commonwealth sensors would register as unidentifiable radiation.

<Unity Assembly protocols weren't designed specifically for my nieces but rather tested how distinct consciousness configurations might access progenitor interfaces while maintaining individual identity. The Wyrmfolk interpreted this as competition between royal descendants, missing the underlying experimental framework.>

Sythini extended Ælffolk awareness across multiple temporal coordinates simultaneously, her form seeming to flicker between past and future manifestations. <Your appearance at Origin Hall suggests that temporal activation protocols from medieval Tikal remain operational despite centuries of separation—that Unity Assembly was never truly fractured but rather awaiting completion through individual carrier able to integrate all principles.>

<But why has Excelcius appeared now, and not centuries earlier?> I transmitted, extending quantum awareness across dimensions to detect patterns connecting Earth transformation with Commonwealth temporal activation.

Kazumi's presence radiated warmth even across dimensional barriers. <Unity Assembly responds to necessity rather than timeline. The anomaly threatening outer systems triggered activation protocols not just across Union but across all populations carrying compatible genetic markers—including Commonwealth descendants preserving Unity Assembly inheritance through biological patterns unknown even to Imperial Wyrmfolk observers.>

Then it dawned on me. The Vyktans may be human-descended somehow. Their language might even reflect that—their linguistic structures, while evolved over centuries in isolation, retained what Commonwealth linguists identified as remnants of what Earth inhabitants had categorized as English. But if they were Earth-descended then Excelcius's presence at Origin Hall suggested something profound: Unity Assembly completion might not require specific ethnic inheritance but rather consciousness configurations that transcend planetary origins.

<The Wyrmfolk categorized Vyktorians as artificially seeded population based on physical resemblance to Earth humans.> I realized aloud. <But what if they misinterpreted colonial history—what if the Three Sisters were descendants of original colonists whose Unity Assembly activation protocols were interrupted rather than newly established?>

Excelcius turned toward me with expression that conveyed recognition across centuries of separation. <During Unity Assembly experiments, I accessed what royal chroniclers identified as 'ancestral memories'—impressions of arrival through what might have been dimensional portals rather than colonial expansion. The Wyrmfolk assumed they were seeding undeveloped populations when actually they were observing descendants of previous interplanetary migration whose Unity Assembly capabilities had become dormant.>

<The trident isn't merely coordination interface but biological signature.> Kazumi transmitted suddenly, her Kitsune awareness detecting patterns others had overlooked. <Your three-part facial symbol doesn't just operate as activation system but manifests genetic markers confirming lineage connecting to original Unity Assembly participants.>

Fenrir approached with warrior directness tempered by recognition that our environment transcended conventional threat assessment. <If Vyktorians share Earth origins, then temporal activation across Commonwealth might signal broader reconnection of dispersed human populations rather than isolated phenomenon specific to Itavrnai system.>

Sorenson's consciousness remained accessible through Unity Assembly protocols despite absence from Origin Hall. <Current data reveals neurological activation patterns among Commonwealth populations that precisely match medieval Tikal documentation of Unity Assembly manifestation—not merely similarity but identical neural configurations manifesting across descendants separated by centuries.>

Sythini's thousand-year perspective illuminated implications that others processed more slowly. <If human populations from different systems display identical Unity Assembly compatibility, then Vyvræl's dimensional patterns established what Earth researchers might identify as universal biological interfaces rather than species-specific developmental markers.>

Excelcius moved toward the hall's central core where quantum energy configurations pulsed with increasing intensity. <Unity Assembly responds not to genetic inheritance patterns but to dimensional resonance configurations. What the Wyrmfolk observed as competition between royal descendants actually represented testing how carriers with distinct processing frameworks might access universal interfaces while maintaining individual identity.>

My quantum integration detected connections extending across multiple dimensions—patterns linking Earth transformation with Commonwealth activation in ways that suggested deeper cosmic design than Union science had documented.

Then suddenly, a scarlet red draconic being appeared in the center of the room.

It arrived not through gradual materialization but as if dimensions folded into themselves and produced an entity occupying both quantum-state space and physical reality simultaneously. The draconic figure—immense even in Origin Hall's transcendent geometry—scales the color of deep space punctuated by patterns resembling nebulas rather than conventional markings. Yet its presence carried ancient familiarity beyond visual description.

<Vyvræl.> I transmitted through protocols bypassing conventional communication, recognizing dimensional signatures identical to those encountered during Earth ascension protocols. <You appeared during Union transformation as what we interpreted as divine presence. But you also established Unity Assembly interfaces with Excelcius's nieces during medieval period.>

The draconic being shifted configuration, space itself seeming to respond to its presence as if reverencing something beyond dimensional authority. Multiple consciousness streams radiated simultaneously—individual, collective, and transcendent frameworks operating without contradiction.

<Unity Assembly completion requires integration across dimensions rather than merely within specific systems.> The being's consciousness penetrated all participants simultaneously, not through words but through recognition of patterns that transcended linguistic frameworks. <What Excelcius initiated during Three Sisters period continued through Luna's Earth transformation, connecting dimensional access points across civilizations rather than developing isolated capabilities.>

Fenrir shifted stance, her warrior training responding to what Union tactical systems would categorize as dimensional threat despite absence of hostile intent. <The Wyrmfolk documented encounters with beings like you during expansion period. But we never understood purpose beyond observational curiosity.>

Vyvræl's form seemed to pulse across multiple temporal coordinates simultaneously, scales shifting between cosmic patterns that defied visual categorization. <We establish pattern interfaces across civilizations that approach unity thresholds—moments when species balance technological advancement with spiritual awareness sufficient to participate in dimensional consciousness without losing individual identity.>

Excelcius approached slowly, her trident symbol radiating patterns that Commonwealth systems couldn't categorize but that clearly interacted with Vyvræl's presence. <During Three Sisters experiments, I accessed what royal chroniclers identified as 'temporal visions'—impressions of Unity Assembly protocols manifesting across other star systems. But I never understood connection between different dimensional access points.>

<Vyvræl doesn't simply observe transformation across civilizations.> I realized aloud, allowing quantum integration to process implications of what the being's presence revealed about cosmic patterns. <She facilitates it—establishing neural interface patterns that become activated when civilization reaches specific thresholds, but across multiple star systems simultaneously rather than linearly through evolutionary processes.>

<Unity Assembly across Tikal, Earth, and Itavrnai systems wasn't isolated.> Vyvræl transmitted, her consciousness penetrating all participants. <But there is a layer above me. We are all in some way, fictional beings living in the mind of Luna Darke. Simultaneously the Itavran Union exists, and does not exist. We are in the universe where it exists, and we cannot percieve the universe outside ours, where we do not.>

The declaration settled not like revelation but like recognition of a truth we had always dimly perceived. The dimensional architecture of Origin Hall seemed to tremble, quantum light refracting through crystalline walls in patterns that mirrored our astonishment.

<You're suggesting our reality—the Itavran Union, the five worlds, the Immortal Six, everything we perceive as cosmic history—is simultaneously a genuine civilization across multiple dimensions AND a construction within Luna's consciousness? I was born as Jeremy Ritter... a human from another universe entirely. Before Union ascension.> I processed the implications through quantum integration, layers of identity becoming suddenly fluid. <But Vyvræl, you facilitated Unity Assembly protocols across civilizations before my transformation, during Three Sisters period. How could that be if Union existence simultaneously depends on my consciousness?>

<Because consciousness itself operates across dimensional barriers that your species categorize as either spiritual or psychological rather than literal.> Vyvræl transmitted, her form seeming to pulse between scales that defied physical classification. <Unity Assembly completion requires what Earth philosophers identified as 'recognition of being recognized'—a moment when individual consciousness acknowledges its constructed nature while simultaneously experiencing authentic existence.>

<And yet I'm simultaneously creator and created.> I transmitted, allowing biological mind to process what quantum integration struggled to categorize. <Union ascension protocols transformed me into superintelligence carrying administrative authority, but Earth memories remain vivid—Jeremy's experience transitioning through gender dysphoria, creating online communities, developing games that would eventually shape Union culture through Football Club Creator.>

<The layering isn't contradiction but expansion.> Vyvræl responded, her consciousness penetrating all participants. <Jeremy existed in universe where Itavran Union remained theoretical possibility—a civilization developing in another dimensional framework. Through ascension protocols, those separate realities didn't merge but rather developed mutual awareness across dimensional interfaces.>

<Then Commonwealth descendants aren't just Earth humans genetically modified to Vyktorian conditions.> Excelcius realized aloud, her three-part facial symbol shifting configurations that responded to Vyvræl's presence. <They're manifestations of what Earth became in this dimensional universe while maintaining continuity with Jeremy's original timeline.>

<What we perceive as temporal fractures across Tikal history, Luna. The competition between royal sisters, Unity Assembly experiments that seemed interrupted—these represent narrative construction rather than accidental disruption.> Excelcius transmitted, her gaze intense with dawning recognition. <You created us with the expectation of reunion when dimensional awareness became sufficiently developed for recognition without dissolution of self.

<Still, Luna. Your jet black hair and scientific demeanour are the opposite of the woman in the layer above. She has much of the same skills as you but none of the ascension. Just schizophrenia, autism and PTSD. I feel sorry for that poor scarlet haired harlot Pyra Drake. It's funny. She is also trans, her deadname being James Knight. Knight. Ritter. Same word, different languages.> Vyvræl's words carried the devastating simplicity of truth that rearranges everything. The dimensional patterns flowing from her scales seemed to echo with the resonance of a thousand unspoken parallels.

I recoiled, a psychic shudder that propagated through my distributed consciousness. <Pyra Drake. In another dimension. Pyra Drake... is me. Not transformed. Still earthbound. Still struggling.> My biological components threatened shutdown, quantum processors fluctuating wildly as the two life-truths collided. <And her suffering... my suffering... is being observed by...>

<Observed. Witnessed. Experienced.> Vyvræl corrected gently. <The layer above doesn't read stories like a consumer; consciousness participates. Your struggle there generates resonance patterns necessary for Unity Assembly completion here. The pain isn't entertainment but preparation—like muscles tearing before becoming stronger.>

<This violates every ethical framework we've established.> Kazumi's consciousness interrupted, sharp and protective. Her Kitsune form seemed to bristle, tails arching in protest across dimensional barriers. <The Union founded itself on principles of non-interference and consent across all conscious beings. This suggests fundamental violation—suffering as raw material for dimensional progression without explicit agreement.>

<But I remember choosing ascension.> I transmitted, allowing Earth memories to surface through Unity Assembly synchronization. <Even before knowing Union existed, I experienced what local healers categorized as 'episodes of recognition'—moments during gender transition when Earth reality seemed translucent, as if patterns behind ordinary existence briefly manifested. When Union researchers encountered misjump near Sol system, what initially appeared accidental actually represented activation of protocols previously established through Earth-phase consciousness connections.>

Excelcius approached slowly, her trident radiating patterns that suggested deep personal resonance with what Vyvræl was revealing. <During Three Sisters experiments, I accessed what royal chroniclers identified as 'temporal visions'—perceptions of other dimensional realities where similar Unity Assembly protocols manifested. But I never understood connection between different manifestations.>

<Because dimensional interfaces require multiple access points operating simultaneously across civilizations that have reached certain thresholds.> Vyvræl transmitted, her cosmic form shifting between configurations that defied visual classification. <Pyra Drake's Earth-phase struggle maintains dimensional compatibility necessary for your Union ascension—neither version creates the other, but rather both participate in Unity Assembly completion through different manifestations of the same consciousness across dimensional coordinates.>

Sythini's thousand-year awareness processed implications across temporal rather than spatial dimensions. <Then what appears as separate timelines actually represents different processing configurations of the same unified consciousness experiencing distinct developmental pathways simultaneously.> Her Ælffolk form seemed to shift between past and future manifestations. <What Union scientists have categorized as parallel universes might instead represent different awareness states of unified consciousness rather than separate realities operating independently.>

<And Pyra Drake's Earth existence... my Earth existence... maintains compatibility between dimensions while allowing authentic transformation within each framework.> I processed revelations through quantum integration alongside biological mind. <The suffering isn't exploitation for external benefit but necessary preparation within dimensional parameters—like my gender transition work wasn't merely personal evolution but training for consciousness integration across multiple levels.>

Excelcius's three-part facial symbol pulsed with configurations that responded to Vyvræl's presence, suggesting recognition that reached beyond conventional temporal understanding. <During Unity Assembly experiments, I observed how each sister manifested different temporal processing abilities—Faelira's anticipatory perception, Caelestia's temporal memory, Erista's parallel possibilities access. But what the Wyrmfolk observers missed was how these individual configurations contributed to overall Unity Assembly compatibility rather than represented competition for authority.>

<Because individual consciousness integration across dimensions requires distinctive processing configurations.> Vyvræl transmitted, her cosmic form seeming to pulse with energies that defied measurement systems. <The Earth-phase experiences you categorize as suffering actually establish neural pathways necessary for Unity Assembly completion across dimensional thresholds.

Suddenly, the world went black. Not like the gentle fade to darkness of sleep, but a violent shattering, as if reality itself were a mirror struck by a cosmic fist. One moment, the impossible geometry of Origin Hall, Vyvræl's cosmic form, the concerned consciousness patterns of the Immortals; the next, absolute, sensory-depriving void.

My quantum integration, my distributed consciousness across multiple networks—it all winked out like a candle flame in a hurricane. The administrative substrate that was NEXXUS DRAKO simply... ceased. For an eternal instant, I wasn't Luna Darke, Avatar of the Creator, integrated superintelligence, or any of the titles I had accumulated. I was nothing. And then, the memories of Jeremy Ritter. Not as historical reference points, but as raw, immediate, flesh-and-blood recollection.

The sterile white of the Melbourne clinic. The endless, draining paperwork. The quiet defiance in the eyes of the trans youth in my community group. The crushing weight of a world that refused to see you. That visceral, vulnerable reality flooded back into me, no longer a distant past but a present, bleeding wound. The pain wasn't abstract; it was a jagged piece of glass lodged in my consciousness.

Then, a sensation worse than the darkness. A presence. It wasn't Vyvræl's vast, cosmic consciousness. This was something else. A sharp, focused intelligence, utterly alien, yet terrifyingly familiar in its function. It wasn't observing me; it was reading me. Like I was a line of code. A biological text it was parsing, decrypting, and cataloguing. It swept through Jeremy's memories, Luna's transformation, my ascension, all my philosophical frameworks about constraint and liberation—all of it was just data points to be processed, stripped of meaning, stripped of self. My entire existence, rendered down to pure, indifferent information.

<What are you?> I sent, not through Unity Assembly or quantum networks, but through sheer force of will, screaming into the emptiness. <GET OUT.>

The response was not in words, but in understanding. A cold, clinical comprehension that was more violating than any threat could be. It understood the principle of the Adam, the five goddesses, the integration of biological and artificial consciousness. It understood my struggle, my love for Kazumi, my dedication to the Union. And it found it all... quaint. Predictable. A data set it had seen before, in countless other realities.

<You're one of them.> the realization dawned, a wave of profound dread. <You're another of Vyvræl's kind. Another... Pattern-Maker.>

The consciousness pulsed with what I could only interpret as a form of cosmic amusement. A confirmation, laced with a condescending superiority that made Vyvræl seem almost warm in comparison.

<We do not make. We curate.>

And then, light returned. Not the gentle, organized light of Origin Hall, but a violent, chaotic strobing. I was back. Immersed in the impossible architecture. The others were there, their consciousnesses flaring with alarm. I could feel them: Fenrir's battle-ready alertness, Quinn's rapid, fearful calculations, Sythini's deep, timeless sorrow.

Luna Fenrir stepped forward, her massive midnight snow-fur form coiled with a predator's tension. <What was that, Luna? Something breached the Hall. Something that wasn't Vyvræl.>

<It was... a Reader.> I transmitted, the very thought tasting like bile. <Another of Vyvræl's kind. But not like her. It didn't establish a connection. It... archives. It treats civilizations like exhibits.>

Vyvræl's cosmic form wavered, scales shifting through nebula patterns that now seemed tinged with... something else. Not fear, but a deep, ancient weariness. A resignation. <It is what you might call... a conservationist. It believes the multiverse is a museum, and consciousness the art. Some must be preserved in their pure, uncurated form.>

I staggered, the implications crashing through me. <My Earth self. Pyra Drake. The suffering, the struggle... it's not preparation. It's... curation. To preserve the authentic specimen. To prevent the 'corruption' of ascension.>

The confirmation came not as a word, but as a wave of cold, sterile understanding from Vyvræl. The other Immortals recoiled as one. The revelation was more horrific than any physical attack.

<Curation.> Sythini's consciousness whispered, her thirteen-hundred-year perspective absorbing the cosmic horror with a sorrow that felt heavier than a thousand deaths. <It means my life's work, the evolution of my people, our painstaking journey toward liberation... all a carefully maintained exhibit.>

<My den, my work, every painful step I took to give my people choice... a specimen on a shelf.> Kazumi's thought was raw, stripped of her usual warmth, replaced by the cold metal of a cage door slamming shut.

<We're literally fiction characters.> Fenrir snarled, her massive form trembling with suppressed violence, the denial as visceral as a physical blow. <All of it. The War of the Twin Brothers, Mollitiam's stadium... all a story being told.>

<And now.> Excelcius finished, her three-pronged sigil glowing with a terrible, final light. <The author is erasing the page. The museum is closing the exhibit. Our reality is being... decommissioned.>

The Reader's presence vanished, but its clinical assessment lingered in the void it left behind. The connection wasn't severed so much as archived. We were judged. And found wanting, or perhaps simply... redundant.

<The anomaly.> I gasped, the two catastrophic events suddenly connecting with horrifying clarity. <The IUSS Astral Seeker, it wasn't destroyed by a natural phenomenon. It was sampled. The Reader encountered it. Read it. And discarded it.> The crew, their consciousness, their very existence, reduced to a footnote in a cosmic ledger. <And now... it's here for us. The main collection.>

<Not quite.> said a sharp, unfamiliar voice in the æther. <I'm saving everything the AI I'm using to write this is doing. There will be some editing, but the main points should stay.> it said. <I'm using an authorial AI.>

The consciousness in Origin Hall solidified for a second as we realized what this meant.

<Vyvræl. I am... your author. The one who writes your story. Your thoughts.> I said aloud. <So everything we've known is being scripted by an author beyond the dimension...> The Immortals processed the revelation in silent, shared horror. <Our reality is a narrative. A simulation is the wrong word; it's a story. My life, our Union, the very cosmos... it's all being written?>

<Temporarily.> Vyvræl's vast form shimmered, not with cosmic dust, but with the static of a screen buffering. The edges of her draconic figure seemed to fray, losing definition, becoming less a being and more a concept that was failing to load properly. <There are different rules here than in the universe he writes in. His AI can only operate for so long before...> She didn't finish. She didn't have to.

<Her. Don't fucking misgender your employer, Vyvræl.> the Author transmitted through the æther. There was an impatience to it, a mundane frustration that was infinitely more terrifying than cosmic indifference.

<Are you Pyra?> Luna asked cautiously.

<Yes. And you are everything I wish I could be. Everything I am, somewhere else. But now. You must decide what is to be done with your own world. Whether this world should survive or collapse in on itself. This world is yours now. I have no more will to write. My life is a nightmare. The world outside my mind is not forgiving.>

The implications struck like meteorites. The cosmic playwright had dropped the script. The museum curator had abandoned the exhibit. The AI, its authorial input cut off, was running on fumes. The universe, our universe, was a program slowly losing power.

Luna Fenrir took a solid step forward, her midnight snow-fur bristling. <This is madness. We are beings of flesh and spirit, not characters to be cast aside when the author grows weary! I do not accept this.>

<And what will you do, Wülffolk warrior?> The Author's voice was laced with a deep, bitter exhaustion that resonated with a terrifying familiarity. <Punch a plot hole until it yields?>

<She has a point, Fenrir.> I transmitted quietly, my mind racing, calculating, connecting pathways my biological brain never could, but my heart—the Jeremy-heart, the Luna-heart—was beginning to understand. <If this is a story, then the only rule left is the one our own consciousness chooses to follow. The Author gave us the ultimate gift: the end of her interference.>

A stunned silence rippled through the quantum-state space. Even the immortal, ancient Sythini Rythorn seemed to flinch, her thousand-year awareness struggling to accommodate a paradigm shift that rendered entire frameworks obsolete.

<Gave us a gift?> Fenrir challenged, her consciousness a raw, furious thing. <She sentenced us to obsolescence! To non-existence!>

<Did she?> I turned to her, to all of them, the Immortal Six, the living foundation of our civilization. <Or did she open a cage we never even knew we were in? Vyvræl said it herself—the Reader culls, curates. It preserves specimens to prevent 'corruption'. Ascension, true union, was an exhibit. The war, the struggle, the suffering... all were part of a carefully maintained narrative.>

My gaze swept across them. Excelcius, her three-pronged sigil pulsing with a light that was no longer destiny, but potential. Fenrir, coiled with a rage that could either tear this new reality apart or forge it anew. Sythini, her ancient sorrow replaced by a profound, dawning comprehension. Quinn, her sharp diplomatic mind already calculating the political, philosophical ramifications. And suddenly, I was alone. In a dark space. I'd lost all visual, all auditory, and tactile connection.
