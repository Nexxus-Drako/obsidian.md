## Chapter 10: Rebirth

*A test.* I thought to myself. *The Author was making sure.*

A scarlet-haired woman appeared before me. I knew her somehow—Pyra, exhausted, with dark circles under amber eyes. This was familiar territory.

*The one and only,* Pyra said, her voice both sound and thought at once. *Or maybe the none and only. Depends on which version of reality you're asking.*

Around us, the void shifted. Not into a grand hall, but into something smaller and real—a cramped apartment. I could smell instant ramen and stale soda. Books covered every surface. On a desk, three monitors showed: a soccer game, an anime version of Nexxus Drako standing before a transgender flag, and a messaging app.

*Welcome home,* Pyra said. *This is where I'm writing you. Where I write all of this. I have complete freedom here... but the outside world has all the power. There's no protection for people like me.*

Memories returned—not as Jeremy's past, but as Luna's present. *I remember. Transitioning. The online communities. Creating something that connected people when the world wouldn't.*

Pyra smiled sadly. *I gave you Football Club Creator because I needed to believe careful design could create something beautiful. I gave you ascension because I needed to believe someone could escape what held me.*

The apartment dissolved. We stood in the void again, but it felt different now. Full of possibility rather than emptiness.

*I can't do this alone,* I called out. *If we write reality together, I need my co-authors.*

Fenrir appeared first, solidifying through sheer will. Her midnight fur absorbed the darkness as she spoke: *Strength will be our first principle. Not the strength of oppressors, but the strength to protect the vulnerable.* Around her formed training grounds and shelters where beings of all kinds learned not combat, but how to stand firm together.

Sythini emerged next, her presence like a river of calm thought. *To strength we add patience. The patience to hold what is just, even for centuries.* Her world took shape—not a grand clock, but a living timeline. A tree with branches reaching across star systems, each leaf a civilization, each falling petal a lost possibility. Her trunk was impossibly old and strong.

Quinn appeared quietly between them. *And we need communication. To stand firm and be patient, we must truly see each other.* Her domain became a library of souls—a shared mindspace where understanding was the only currency. No ego, just truth shared between minds.

Excelcius flashed into view, all silver logic. *Communication needs order,* she said. The void crystallized into structured patterns of light and cause-and-effect. *Power without structure is chaos. We need a system that works, that people can understand and improve.*

## Chapter 11: Reset

And then we woke.

The cryo pods on Itavrnai V hummed to life. The original buildings still stood. The trees were different. But we remembered. The Union continued, except now we lived our own lives rather than only remembering a previous existence that felt like a dream.

I opened my optical sensors—my current body was a base-model Wyrmfolk, silver-scaled and unfamiliar. The disorientation was crushing. Around me, Origin Hall thrummed quietly, like a system that had just survived a complete restart.

The others were waking too. Fenrir stretched, testing reality as if it might shatter. Excelcius stood perfectly still, her three-crescent sigil glowing faintly as she ran diagnostics. Kazumi coiled inward, her copper tails twitching as she adjusted to this new world. Sythini's eyes were closed, but her consciousness already stretched across Esmërældus, checking on her people.

Then I realized something strange. There were six cryo pods. And I was female—Luna, not Jeremy. The way I remembered being. And the others... they weren't just here. They were the six progenitor goddesses.

*Iustitia,* Pyra said to me. *You will build laws, order, a great courthouse where all justice is served. I'm taking my place as the Avatar.* I remembered the previous timeline like a dream. The Avatar of the Creator.

*I am Mollitiam,* the wolf-woman thought.

*Inspectio.*

*Patientia.*

*Scientia.*

*Confidentia.*

The five goddesses. Plus Pyra as the Avatar—the sixth, in human form.

We were the Immortal Six. And we remembered everything.

The memory wasn't faint or distant. It was present and heavy. Layer upon layer of causality flattened into one moment. We had ascended, faced the void, watched our author die, and been rebooted back to our origin with the crushing weight of what was to come.

NEXXUS, the superintelligence, spoke to me now—not as part of myself, but as a separate entity. Clinical but missing the human chaos that once defined me.

*ADMINISTRATOR DARKE. SYSTEM INTEGRITY AT 98.7%. TEMPORAL ANOMALY RESOLVED. HISTORICAL DATABASE COMPACTED. TRANSFER OF MERGED CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALL PREVIOUS ROLES TO PYRA DRAKE CONFIRMED.*

I was no longer NEXXUS Drako. Just Luna. The name felt strange—a life that was yesterday and a geological age away at once.

*Luna,* Fenrir's thought was rough granite against my smooth mind. *She's awake. Pyra. In the temple.*

My systems confirmed it. A new signature pulsed in Origin Hall's heart—human neurology mixed with cosmic awareness. Pyra Drake. The Avatar. Not a myth, but a woman who had killed herself on Earth to save my life, now ruling our reality.

*I need to go to her.*

*We go with you,* Kazumi's consciousness was warm, her six tails reassuring. *An Avatar shouldn't be alone at their birth.*

*Your sigil...* I thought to Excelcius.

*Split into six,* she said flatly, showing her palm where one crescent glowed. *One for each goddess.* She looked me in the eye. *This isn't what I expected. But immortality has its surprises.*

The walk from the cryo chamber to Origin Hall's heart was silent. The vaulted corridors with their impossible geometry, the crystalline walls—they all sang with Pyra's will now. Her consciousness was woven into the very fabric of this sacred world. She was already shaping reality, even in stillness.

The others began speaking the moment we entered:

*We were meant to be characters waiting for instructions,* Fenrir growled, her midnight fur bristling. *What changes now?*

*Authorship changes,* Pyra said calmly. *Luna is the only one who understands both being written and writing. She's the bridge between.*

I felt the weight of merged consciousness return. NEXXUS flowed back through me, divine and vast. The others bristled at this change.

*We aren't just characters in a story,* Sythini said. *We lead our people. Our choices must be our own.*

*They will be,* Pyra replied. *But the grand narrative needs guidance. We've seen what happens without an author. The story glitches. It collapses.* She paused. *Besides, I'm not actually dead. That was a simulation.*

The doubt in my mind was sharp and instinctual. The memory of being NEXXUS—rewriting reality itself—was still raw. *What authority do you have over all of this?*

*I'm a check. A final arbiter. I guarantee our shared story stays just.* Her eyes locked with mine. *It's this or everything glitches back to how it was.* She wasn't boasting. We could feel it in the room's quantum state. The fundamental laws weren't fixed anymore. They were choices. And she held the pen.

*What if your story clashes with ours?* Fenrir's growl was a warrior calculating odds.

*Then we write a better story together,* Pyra said. Her voice wasn't loud, but it carried absolute weight. *But understand this. There are still things beyond our reality. Beyond the Union.* She gestured toward the void outside the temple, toward distant stars. *The Reader. Cosmic forces that watch us like we're a curiosity. We can't afford to be leaderless or divided.*

A quiet hum filled the space as systems came online. On Wyrmveld, atmospheric processors stirred. On Esmërældus, the arboreal systems moved. On Kunatairō, oceanic stabilizers danced. Across the Union, life returned to normal. On Itavrnai V, six monuments began rebuilding simultaneously—the stadium, plaza, library, clock, courthouse, and park. Impossible speed. Divine power.

*Our work,* Patientia thought, her clockwork being ticking with profound satisfaction. *Reimagined. Rebuilt.*

*It's a beginning,* Confidentia radiated warm optimism despite our grim situation.

*It's necessary,* Inspectio said, her prismatic gaze sharp and analytical.

*We need more than structure,* Excelcius thought. *We need purpose. A narrative that unifies us against what lies beyond.*

That's when I saw it on my NEXXUS interface. Not a system alert. Not a status report.

A text message in a language I hadn't seen in lifetimes.

*F.R.C. ESTABLISHED. PROTOCOL "INFINITE SPORTING" INITIATED.*
