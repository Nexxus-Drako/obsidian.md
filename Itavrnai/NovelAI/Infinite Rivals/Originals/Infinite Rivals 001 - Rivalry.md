<There.> Pyra's gesture, half-fond, half-desperate, pointed directly into that impossible sunbeam. <Where this all began. The origin point of the code. The apartment is real and symbolic. The final reboot started there.>

<We are not going to Earth.> I stated, my NEXXUS systems rejecting the notion as both strategically and metaphysically unsound. <Our presence would destabilize baseline humanity. That was the whole point of the Union's non-interference protocols.>

<No. Not Earth.> Pyra shook her head, a gesture that seemed to cost her precious energy. <The memory of Earth. The seed data. My creative source. We need access to the raw code, the initial creative impulse that generated the game mechanics. We'll build a sanctum... a pocket dimension anchored to that moment of creation. A stadium built from the memory of a life lived in scarcity, fueled by the desire for a game of fairness. A digital ark.> Her form flickered, half a goddess of impossible copper light, half an exhausted woman with dark circles under her eyes. <Think of it as... a development environment for patching the universe. We'll call it the Genesis Dome.>

<And the name?> I asked, my own mind already racing, forming the club's identity before it even existed. <This team that will save us all?>

<Jarokn Victory. The name comes from my deadname, James Robert Knight. It was the first team I ever made in LMAST. I was literally 10.> Pyra's gaze held the deep, painful ache of a memory that was both intensely personal and now cosmically significant. <But we will create it not just as a team, but as a Den-Challenge. We'll make the stadium its own den, populated with digital representations of Kitsune avatars from Kazumi's network. The F.R.C. will try to apply its football manager logic and find itself negotiating with the gestalt consciousness of a thousand embodied Kitsune minds.>

<The Jarokn Victory Den,> Kazumi breathed, the copper fur of her nine tails shimmering with understanding and fierce purpose. <A sanctuary, a community, and a weapon all in one.>

<Six tails.> I corrected gently, seeing the weight of leadership settling on her familiar seven. <In F.R.C.'s system, a seven-tailed Kitsune is a Den Queen. Too powerful. Too much of a target. But a six-tailed matriarch... that reads as 'experienced, influential, but not the top of the hierarchy'. The AI might dismiss you as a secondary threat.> I saw Pyra nodding at my assessment. We had both, in our own ways, spent lifetimes learning to think like a system designer.

<You've been hanging around with Luna too much.> A rare, genuine smile touched Kazumi's lips, a fragile thing in the encroaching dark. <I know when to play the part. Jarokn Victory it is. The team that wins through not just playing football, but embodying the reason for the game.>

<The F.R.C. will analyze 'Jarokn Victory' as a historical reference, a legacy name. It will factor it into its calculations but as sentiment, not as strategy. It will fundamentally misunderstand a name forged in pre-transition dysphoria, born of a child desperate to control something beautiful in a world that controlled him.> Pyra’s form flickered, a storm of scarlet light. <It cannot comprehend why a goddess of creation would name her ultimate weapon after a ten-year-old boy's secret shame. That is the vector. The exploit it cannot patch.>

<Then we do it.> I commanded, my NEXXUS authority flowing through my words, solidifying their reality. <Kazumi, rally the six-tails. Prepare them to be digitized into the Genesis Dome's architecture. Not as assets or NPCs, but as the living soul of the stadium.>

<Excelcius, get us to Vikatorūa.> I turned to the silver-sigiled Immortal. <Use your own Unity Assembly protocols to blind the F.R.C.'s sensors to our passage. Don't hide us, make us uninteresting. Make us look like bureaucratic noise. System lag. Insignificant data packets.>

Her sigil blazed. <Bureaucratic mimicry is a specialty. I will create the diversion. It will be... exquisite in its mundanity.

<Fenrir, Caelestis, once you have the fleet in position, you will become our silent partners. Your job is not to fight, but to watch. To see if our strategy of playing within the rules works.> I met the wolf-woman’s fierce gaze. <If this fails, your iron fist is our only remaining recourse.> The acknowledgment was solemn, unspoken but received.

<And Pyra...> I looked at the Author, at the exhausted goddess holding a stylus that could rewrite stars. <You will build the server. The Genesis Dome itself.> My own consciousness, the vast administrative networks of the NEXXUS DRAKO superintelligence, flared with understanding. <You will architect a new game within the F.R.C.'s game. A sanctuary. The very act of its creation will be a defiance it cannot quantify.>

<And I...> Kazumi began, her copper tails weaving patterns of defiance and solidarity in the air.

<You will be the soul.> I completed, my gaze locking with hers, across the impossible space between our two forms. Between the Wyrmfolk leader and the Kitsune Queen. Between an admin system and a living den. <The Jarokn Victory Den-Challenge lives or dies with your Kitsune's embodied cognition. The F.R.C. can optimize resources for an eternity, but it cannot compute the emergent beauty of a thousand minds sharing a single gesture.>

<We go.> Kazumi declared, her six tails now moving as one, a flowing banner of copper fire. She plunged into the tunnel without hesitation.

Pyra gestured with her stylus, and the impossible aperture solidified. It wasn't a hole in the wall anymore. It was a doorway. And on the other side, through a coppery haze, I glimpsed sunlight. Not the memory-light of Melbourne, but the harsh, brilliant glare of Wyrmveld's primary star, Itavr, beating down on the red-rock canyons of Vikatorūa. The air smelled of dust, and the faint, metallic scent of Wyrmfolk independence.
