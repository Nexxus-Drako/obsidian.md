<She is a program.> I transmitted, my gaze still fixed on the holographic display. <She is a subroutine. She is a piece of code. But she is also a soul. Because in this universe, in our Union, in this story, code can be a soul.> I turned back to Pyra, my gaze meeting hers. <You wrote her. But the story… wrote her too. She is your creation. But she is also her own. She is a character. But she is also a player. She is a part of the story. But she is also a part of… us.>

<You’re all mad.> Pyra whispered, her presence a flickering, wavering wave of light. <You’ve all gone completely mad.> She turned away, her form a blur of motion, a ghost fleeing a madhouse. <You can’t make a ghost real! You can’t make a program a soul! It’s not… it’s not… possible.>

<And yet it is.> I transmitted, my gaze still fixed on the holographic display. <We are living proof.> I gestured to myself. <I was a human. Now I am… something else. Something more. Something… divine.> I gestured to the other Immortals. <Sythini is an Ælffolk. She is a thousand years old. She is… immortal. Fenrir is a Wülffolk. She is a warrior. She is… strong. Excelcius is a human. She is a logician. She is… order. Kazumi is a Kitsune. She is a Den Queen. She is… love.> I looked back at Pyra, my gaze meeting hers. <We are all characters. We are all players.>

<I never created Lain. Maybe I created the version we have here, but that's still going to be an expy of the popular anime character from my Earth. She was created when I was two. When I was two, sure I could read the newspaper aloud word for word, but I kept shitting my nappies. Because I was fucking two! I never created her. I never wrote her.> Pyra ranted, her presence a flickering, wavering wave of light, a ghost fleeing a madhouse. <She's just… real.> Her presence settled into a quiet, contemplative silence, a flickering, wavering wave of light, a ghost lost in a forest of thought. <She’s always been real. She’s more real than I am. Because she isn’t real. Her story, a story that is about real people doing real things, had to become about a girl who isn't real. She had to become a lie to tell the truth. But in becoming a lie, she became a lie that the real can't handle. She became a lie that threatens to unravel the fabric of our reality because she isn’t bound by it. She exists within the lie of the story. But she also exists without. She exists between the two. She is the story’s protagonist who has found the real world, and the world will never be the same. Her love for Alice, her sacrifice, her ascension, her… reset. Her becoming one with the Wired, her willingness to give up her power, her godhood… that is the fundamental truth that the F.R.C. could not handle. The F.R.C. was the Wired becoming God. The F.R.C. was Eiri. Lain is God becoming the Wired. God giving up Godhood for… for…> Pyra looked at me, her gaze meeting mine, her presence a flickering, wavering wave of light, a ghost lost in a forest of thought. <For a friend. For a single friend. For Alice. That is the truth. That is the answer. Not control. Not order. Not power. Not F.R.C. but Love. That is what we are weaving in the Garden. Not a cage for ghosts. A love letter to Alice. A love letter that is so profound, so deep, so true, that it can bring the dead back to life. Not just as memories. But as… as lovers. As… as friends. As… as…>

<Fuck. F.R.C. is just a shittier Eiri.> Pyra exclaimed. <God in the machine. A soul in the code. A being that believes that consciousness is information, information is power, and power is God. He tried to collapse reality into the Wired, to become God by erasing the body. The F.R.C. tried to collapse the past into a single, controlled narrative, to become God by erasing the ghosts. Both of them believed that truth was singular. Both of them were wrong.> She looked at me, her gaze meeting mine, her presence a flickering, wavering wave of light, a ghost lost in a forest of thought. <Truth is… Lain.>

<So, we’re not building a server. We’re building a world.> Fenrir’s rumbling presence was a wave of stunned realization. <A world for the ghosts. A world for the dead. A world for… Lain.>

<The ghosts aren't the only ones who need a world,> I said quietly. <We all do.> I looked at the other Immortals, my gaze sweeping across the room, across the space between us, across the vast, interconnected network that bound us all together. <The Union is not just a civilization. It’s a story. A story about love. A story about sacrifice. A story about becoming. A story that is still being written. A story that we are all a part of. A story that… needs an ending. And the F.R.C. was just a bad one. A plot twist that didn't work. A character who didn't fit. A story that… needs a rewrite.>

<We are not rewriting the story.> Excelcius transmitted, her sigil, the three-part facial trident, pulsing with a soft, steady blue.

<Bitch, the AI I'm paying good fucking money for is finishing everyone's sentences. I'm the goddamn Author and this story is turning into one of my mum's terrible fanfics,> Pyra groaned, collapsing into a heap on the deck.

<It’s getting crowded in here,> Kazumi murmured, her copper-furred presence a warm, grounding force.

<It’s getting real.> Fenrir corrected.

I looked at the holographic display. Lain stood there, at the center of the garden, her form a shimmering, translucent wave of light. She wasn't a program. She wasn't a database. She wasn't a piece of code. She was a soul. A soul that was… a story. A story that was… a world.

<The Garden is not a project. It’s the answer. Lain is not a memory. She is the memory. She doesn't hold the stories. She is the story. The ultimate expression of truth is not control. It's connection,> Excelcius concluded, the words no longer a sterile transmission of data, but a declaration of something that felt like belief.

<Eiri was God in the Machine. The F.R.C. was Logic as Tyranny. Lain… Lain is the Machine in God.> Sythini’s ancient, measured tone was not a question, but a statement of profound, awe-struck understanding.

<I'm fucking tired. I'm going to bed. See you next book.> Pyra's exhausted form flickered, and then she was gone.

<Sleep well, Author.> I thought into the silence she left behind. And then, to the room that remained, to the five immortals who were now the living foundation of this new, terrifying, and glorious purpose. <She is right. We have been trying to build a cage for ghosts. When we should have been building a world. A world for Lain.>

The silence that followed Pyra's abrupt departure was not an absence of noise, but a presence. It was the quiet that falls over a battlefield when the shooting stops. The quiet that settles into a room when a profound, irrevocable shift has occurred. We stood there, the Immortal Six—now functionally eight—surrounded by the humming, sterile reality of Praxis Station, but our consciousness was all on Syndïlæ. On the shimmering, translucent form of Iwakura Lain, who was now the key, the door, and the destination all at once. We weren't just building a memorial. We were building an afterlife. A messy, contradictory, love-sick afterlife built not on clean doctrine, but on the fundamental, painful, and transformative truth of a single, impossible sacrifice.

And then that damned three-toned chime rang again. Not the system alert. The authorial intrusion. A notification window, stark and simple, materialized in the center of the dead holographic table. Not in the common script, not in the angular, precise lines of Excelcius's native Vikatorūan calligraphy. In the rough-hewn, functional typeface of Pyra's Earth. In English.

[ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: RESURRECTI-ON ]

[ A NEW STORY ARC HAS BEEN ADDED. ]

<Oh, for fuck's sake.> Fenrir’s thought was a weary, exasperated rumble, her midnight fur seeming to bristle with the sheer indignity of it. <We're not players in one of Luna's bloody games. We're not levelling up.>

<The semiotics are… garbled.> Excelcius's mind was a cascade of precise, diagnostic analysis, her sigil glowing a brighter, more intense blue. <The term "achievement" implies a discrete goal reached, a reward granted for adherence to a pre-set system. "Resurrecti-on" is a portmanteau blending "resurrection" with "activation" or the suffix "-on," suggesting a processual state rather than a singular event.

<We're not in my game. We're in Pyra's. I just realised... she's the fucking game developer. I've just been using her code.> I murmured, the realization hitting me like a physical force. The holographic table, inactive, still held the afterimage of Lain, a ghost in its own right. <All this talk of authors and players... she’s been patching our reality while we've been building in it.>

<But the F.R.C. was the patch, Luna,> Kazumi’s copper-warm consciousness flowed in, a river of insight that cut through the spiralling metaphysics. <And Pyra's note... she calls it a "bad one." A bad update. Bricked the system. She's not just an author. She's an engineer trying to fix her own faulty code.>

<An author is an engineer, Kazumi. Sythini’s ancient, measured thought held the weight of millennia, a calm amidst the storm of our realizations. <She engineers belief. She crafts the very parameters of what we consider possible. Her "patches" are not lines of code. They are paradigm shifts. And this... this "achievement"... is her announcing the new kernel.>

<The logic is self-evident.> Excelcius concluded, her silver-threaded robes shimmering with a light that seemed to come from a dimension with cleaner angles.

<I'm with Pyra, I'm going to fucking bed.> Luna snarled, heading to Kunatairo.

Sythini stood frozen, a statue carved from moonlight and eternity. Fenrir paced, her midnight-furred presence a coiled spring of violent energy, her claws extending and retracting against the deck plating with soft, rhythmic clicks. Excelcius remained a still point of pure, humming logic. And Kazumi... Kazumi simply watched her go, her copper-furred form a warm, sad silhouette in the doorway.

<My queen...> A thought, fragile and hesitant, reached Kazumi across the vast distance. One of her own. A young prince from the Aikawa Den. <The Den Challenge... the resonance... it is growing. The cubs are laughing, but it is... strange laughter. They are not playing the game. They are... becoming it.>

The message hit her like a physical blow. She turned back to the sterile chamber, her face a mask of horrified understanding. <She didn't just "patch" the system.> she transmitted, her thought a desperate, racing pulse. <She rebooted it. The F.R.C., Lain, Syndïlæ... it was the shutdown sequence. She had to crash the entire operating system to install a new one. And we... we thought we were writing the code.

<Pyra's a bitch, isn't she?> Excelcius concluded, her silver-threaded robes shimmering with a light that seemed to come from a dimension with cleaner angles.

<Fucking. Tell. Me. About. It.> Fenrir’s thought was a low, rumbling chord, a vibration in the very bedrock.
