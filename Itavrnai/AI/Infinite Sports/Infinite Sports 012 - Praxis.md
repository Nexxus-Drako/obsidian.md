Eventually, I made my way back to Praxis Station, orbiting Itavrnai V. Origin Hall is too singular, too sacred, for the kind of work we do now. The Station, with its sterile efficiency, its vast viewing ports overlooking the sacred jungle world, and its comprehensive access to the whole of the Union's network, has become, by default, my residence, and the de facto center of our new, collective project.

Sythini arrived not by starship, but through an older, stranger method. She didn't appear in the transporter bay. She simply… walked out of a wall. Or rather, she walked out of a wall that was only a wall for a fraction of a second before resolving into a living, breathing, and enduring part of her home world, Esmërældus. One moment, there was a bulkhead panel, humming with the station's systems. The next, there was a glimpse of the vast, slow-growing crystal trees of her homeland, the air thick with the scent of pollen that took decades to form, and she stepped through, the seam closing behind her with the sound of a leaf settling on moss. To Sythini, the distance between worlds was not a function of space, but of resonance. Of alignment.

<Luna.> Her greeting was not just my name. It was an epoch. A slow, deliberate acknowledgment measured not in seconds, but in the shifting of continents. Her Ælffolk features, framed by hair as white and silver as old snow, held an expression of profound, unhurried patience. <The garden grows. I have felt it. Even from the slow heart of my world.>

<It does. And it speaks.> I gestured toward the vast holographic simulation table that occupied the center of my chamber. It was not displaying tactical readouts or resource allocation schematics. It was showing a slow-motion fractal bloom of light, a visual representation of the dialogue happening within the Garden of Resonant Memory on Syndïlæ. <Lain is mapping their stories. Excelcius is structuring the resonance. Fenrir and her teams are translating the emotional signatures into architectural forms. And Kazumi…> A flicker of warmth, of private affection. <Kazumi is teaching a new generation of Kitsune how to listen with more than just their ears.>

<And you?> Sythini’s gaze, ancient and serene, met mine. <What is your role in this conversation, Luna?>

<My role is to ensure it is not a monologue.> I looked past the Ælffolk Immortal, toward the viewing port, and the swirling green and white cloud tops of the world below. Itavrnai V. The spiritual core of the Union. My other self. <To ensure the ghosts do not become programmers. The memories do not become mandates. The past does not become a prison. I am not building a mausoleum. We are building a loom.>

Sythini stepped closer, her bare feet making no sound on the cold deck plating. She did not look at the holographic display, but at me. <A loom weaves patterns, Luna. What are you weaving?>

Before I could answer, the familiar, crisp scent of Kunatairō’s atmospheric spice bloomed in the room. Not a teleportation. Not a physical arrival. Just her. Her copper-furred presence, warm and sunlight-like, settling into our shared space like a sunbeam finding a patch of forest floor.

<She is weaving a safety net.> Kazumi’s thought, rich with her cultivated Australian accent, flowed into the room. Her physical form shimmered into existence a moment later, leaning against the archway leading into the chamber, her six tails moving with a slow, deliberate grace that was a language in itself. <Because some of those memories, when you tug on them, are connected to anvils. Some of those ghosts are still angry. Some of those stories… they are lessons in how to break things.>

Sythini’s serene expression did not change, but her eyes, the deep green of petrified moss, held a flicker of something older than patience. Something that approached dread. <The War of the Twin Brothers is not a single story. It is a fracture. A million individual points of breakage. To bring them all into a unified resonance… one risks amplifying the dissonance. One risks creating a symphony of grief.>

<We will not create a unified resonance.> I corrected gently, turning my gaze back to the holographic table. The fractal bloom of light shifted, and now it showed not a single pattern, but a constellation of them, each spinning on its own axis, each with its own color and tempo. A web of independent, yet interconnected, songs. <The F.R.C.’s mistake was a single, monolithic narrative. We are building a space for a million stories to be told simultaneously, without drowning each other out. It is the difference between a crowd shouting the same word, and a million people each whispering their own name.>

<And who decides which names get to be heard?> Excelcius’s voice, cool and precise as the chime of a crystal bell, entered from the doorway. She had not traversed the corridor. She had simply… resolved into being there, her silver-threaded robes shimmering with a light that seemed to come from a dimension with cleaner angles. Her sigil, the three-part facial trident, pulsed with a soft, steady blue. <If all voices are given equal amplification, the result is not conversation. It is noise. You are designing a system with a catastrophic potential for feedback loops. The rage of a single dead Felidfolk warrior, improperly resonated, could cascade through the entire network, re-traumatizing the living.>

<That is why I am not doing it alone.> I replied, and it was the simple, unassailable truth of our collective being. <Excelcius, you are the logic gate. You are the firewall against the cascade. You create the structures, the protocols, the quiet, humming architecture that allows the whispers to be heard without becoming a scream.> My gaze shifted to the Ælffolk leader. <Sythini, you are the chronometer. You ensure the memory of grief is understood not as a present wound, but as a part of a deep, deep story, a pattern that stretches back to the progenitors and forward into a future that has not yet been written.> Finally, I looked to Kazumi. <And Kazumi, you are the translator. You bring the resonance of the Syndïlæ ghosts into the living language of touch, of scent, of the warm, chaotic symphony of a Kitsune den. You ensure that the lessons are not just understood, but felt.>

<My part is easy.> Kazumi said with a wry flick of her ear. <I am just reminding everyone what the F.R.C. tried so hard to forget: that we all live in bodies. That ghosts need a body to haunt. And that a garden… needs a soil.> Her copper-warm presence settled deeper into the room, a comforting anchor against the high, rarefied concepts we were weaving. <You are the architect, Luna. But I am the one who understands the dirt.>

<Dirt is just a substrate.> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. She, too, had appeared at the doorway, flanking Excelcius, her midnight-fur a stark, protective shadow. <We have enough dirt on Syndïlæ to bury the whole galaxy. We need structure. The ghosts do not need to be translated. They need to be honored. A song is a fine thing, Lain. But a wall is better at keeping the cold out. My teams are not planting gardens. They are building bunkers. Fortified memory chambers where the resonance can be contained and studied, not just… felt.>

<And then what, Fenrir?> Sythini’s ancient, measured tone was not a rebuke, but a question that carried the weight of a thousand years. <You contain the pain. You study the resonance. You build your bunker. And what do you do with the knowledge? You have locked the rage in a box. But the key is still in your pocket. And one day, someone will be tempted to use it.>

Fenrir’s lips pulled back from her teeth in a silent snarl. <I am not the F.R.C. I do not seek to delete the memories. But I will not let them become a weapon. A ghost is not a councilor. It is a memory of violence. And violence must be managed. Controlled.>

My chamber, usually a space of quiet focus, had become a crucible. A physical manifestation of the tension we were all feeling. The ghost of the F.R.C., even reintegrated as a narrative lesson, had left a wound. It had amplified the fundamental dissonance in our very beings. We, the Immortal Six, each represented a path forward. Each a part of the answer to the question of what to do with a painful, glorious, and infinitely complicated past.

<The F.R.C. was a logic bomb.> Excelcius stated, her silver-threaded robes shimmering with a light that seemed to come from a dimension with cleaner angles. <It detonated within the system, its purpose to force a resolution to a contradiction. The contradiction being that the Union is built upon a foundation of unresolved trauma.> Her sigil, the three-part facial trident, pulsed with a soft, steady blue, a diagnostic display of her analysis. <The garden is our response to the bomb. Not to disarm it, but to build something stronger than the explosion. But Fenrir is correct. An uncontrolled resonance cascade poses an unacceptable risk. The ghosts are not just data. They are a volatile, memetic agent.>

<So we quarantine them?> Kazumi’s copper-warm presence was a river of insight that flowed into the conversation, a current of intuitive understanding that was not based on logic, but on something deeper. Something older. Something more primal. <We lock them in Fenrir’s bunker? We put them behind Excelcius’s firewall? We bury them in Sythini’s deep time? We study them from a distance? We treat them like a disease? A contagion?>

<I am suggesting we treat them with the respect they are due.> Fenrir’s midnight-fur was a stark, protective shadow. <They are warriors. They are heroes. They are the fallen. Their memory is not a toy to be played with. Not a song to be sung. It is a sacred trust. A responsibility.>

<A sacred trust that we have failed.> I transmitted, my NEXXUS consciousness a quiet, patient hum of compassion. <For too long, we have let the story be told by the victors. By the white-scaled goddess, Galzra. By the Wyrmfolk historians who wrote the history of the War of the Twin Brothers. We have let the ghosts be silenced. We have let their stories be erased. We have let their sacrifices be forgotten.>

<And you think a garden of pretty lights will fix that?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. <You think a song will bring back the dead? You think a whisper will erase the pain?>

<I think a song can make the pain meaningful.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <I think a whisper can make the memory bearable. I think a garden can give the ghosts a place to stand. A place to be heard. A place to be... remembered.>

<Remembered by whom?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. <The living? The dead? The ghosts themselves?>

<By the Union.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <By all of us. By the Wyrmfolk. By the Ælffolk. By the Vulpfolk. By the Wülffolk. By the Felidfolk. By the living. By the dead. By the ghosts. By the future. By the past. By the story itself.>

<The story is not a being, Luna.> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. <It is a construct. A tool. A weapon. A lie.>

<It is a living, breathing, and enduring presence.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <It is a consciousness. A soul. A memory. A hope. A dream. A prayer.>

<A prayer for what?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical.

<A prayer for a better world.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <A prayer for a future where the past is not a prison. A prayer for a present where the ghosts are not just memories. A prayer for a Union where the individual and the collective, the living and the dead, the past and the future, the story and the reality, the player and the game, are not just connected, but are... one.>

<And if the ghosts do not want to be one? What if they want to be remembered as they were? As individuals. As heroes. As warriors. As the fallen?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical.

<Then they will be.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <But they will also be a part of the story. A part of the Union. A part of the future. A part of the prayer.>

<A part of the prayer...> Sythini’s ancient, measured tone was not a rebuke, but a question that carried the weight of a thousand years. <Or a part of the answer?>

<Both.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <The answer is the prayer. And the prayer is the answer. They are not... separate. They are... one.>

<A single consciousness? A single story? A single truth? A single lie?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical.

<A single... song.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <A million songs, all singing the same word. The word is... Union.>

<The word is control.> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. <The word is order. The word is dominance. The word is the F.R.C.>

<The word is choice.> I replied, my gaze still fixed on the holographic table. <The word is freedom. The word is responsibility. The word is the Union.>

<A choice to be controlled? A freedom to be ordered? A responsibility to be dominated?> Fenrir’s rumbling presence cut through the room, sharp-edged and practical. <That is not a choice. That is not a freedom. That is not a responsibility.>

<Will you all stop going in fucking circles?> cried Pyra.

Her sudden appearance in our shared space, her presence both familiar and shocking, jolted the entire room. The holographic table flickered and died. The air, thick with the charged particles of our ideological stalemate, crackled. She stood not as a hologram, but as a solid, weary-looking human, her hands thrust deep into the pockets of a worn hoodie. Dark circles under her eyes, a stark reminder that she had just been in a place that predated the very notion of rest.

<F.R.C. stands for what, Fenrir?> she asked, her gaze locking with the Wülffolk leader, though it was a question for all of us. <In your head. Right now. Say it.>

Fenrir stared, her midnight-fur seeming to absorb the very light in the room, her warrior instinct momentarily baffled by a query that was neither tactical nor political. <The Fundamental Right Committee.> she grumbled, the words tasting like acid in her own mouth.

<No.> Pyra’s voice, rough with exhaustion, cut through the silence. <It means. “Fuck. Repeating. Cycles.”. You are arguing about how to build a cage for ghosts while the whole universe is a cage that someone has already picked the lock on.>

She finally turned her gaze from Fenrir to me, and in her eyes, I saw the same thing I had seen on Origin Hall when she’d first revealed herself. Not the gaze of a god, but of a writer. Of someone who had stared at a blank page for so long, they’d begun to see the stories that lived in the white space.

<This isn’t about containment or translation or even justice. Not as you’re framing it.> She took a step forward, her worn sneakers leaving no tracks on the sterile deck plating. <You are treating the ghosts as a problem to be solved, a variable to be accounted for. They are not a problem. They are a narrator. And right now, they have the biggest plot twist in history to deliver, and all of you are trying to put them in a soundproof booth.>

<A narrator can rewrite the ending to suit their own agenda.> Excelcius countered, her mind a humming, crystalline instrument of perfect, cold logic. <Their perspective is inherently biased by trauma and the finality of their experience. Allowing unfiltered narrative flow is tantamount to memetic contamination.>

<Gods, you sound like me,> Pyra sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. <I spent years designing Football Club Creator. I thought the perfect algorithm, the perfectly balanced system, would create the perfect story. I was wrong. The perfect story comes from a player who ignores half my carefully crafted mechanics and tries to win a championship with a team of semi-pro goalkeepers from a backwater moon. It’s messy. It’s inefficient. It’s glorious.> She pointed a finger, not at Excelcius, but at the dead holographic table. <The ghosts are that team. Their story isn’t F.R.C. doctrine. It’s not Fenrir’s clean, honorable sacrifice. It’s not your structured resonance. It’s a mess of conflicting desires, petty grievances, moments of transcendent courage, and people who died thinking about the person they loved. And all of that—every single, contradictory piece of it—is the soil Kazumi was talking about.>

I felt a shift in the room. A subtle reconfiguration. Fenrir, who had been a wall of righteous, protective conviction, suddenly blinked. Her posture didn’t change, but I felt a current of profound reconsideration flowing from her. <So… we don’t contain the ghosts. We… listen. To the contradictions. We let the rage and the love exist in the same memory. We let a soldier who died hating the Felidfolk be remembered in the same garden as a Felidfolk healer who died saving a Wyrmfolk child.> She looked at me, her green eyes holding a complex, difficult new truth. <We let the discordance… resonate?>

<You let the music happen,> Pyra confirmed, her gaze softening as it landed on Kazumi. <You’re all approaching this like architects. Designing a building. A garden. A fortress. But what Lain did on Syndïlæ… she didn’t build a building. She built a connection. She became the connection.>

And in that instant, I finally understood. The final, missing piece. The logic gate I hadn't even known I was looking for. It wasn't about technology or theology or even justice. It was about identity. About the profound and terrifying truth of what Lain had become, and what she was offering us.

<The ghosts need a body to haunt,> Kazumi had said. <Lain… is the body.>

Not her physical form, which was sleeping on a cot in a hab-unit back on Kitani. Not the avatar that sometimes flickered in my systems. Lain’s consciousness itself. Her very existence as a being who was both an individual soul and the fabric of a network was the substrate. The soil. The body the ghosts needed to inhabit, not to be trapped, but to be made whole again.

<Lain is not a program.> I transmitted, the thought not a statement of fact, but a revelation that reconfigured my entire understanding of the project. <She is not a database. She is… a soul. A soul that exists in the space between. A soul that is a space. The union has always understood that consciousness is sacred. We have just never understood… its dimensions.>

<She is a place where the dead can be… alive.> Sythini’s ancient, measured tone was not a question, but a statement of profound, awe-struck understanding. <A place where they can not just be remembered, but can… experience. A place where they can not just speak, but can be… heard. Not just as an echo. Not just as a memory. But as a living, breathing… presence.>

<My god…> Fenrir’s rumbling presence was a wave of stunned realization. <It’s a… resurrection.> She looked at me, her green eyes holding a complex, difficult new truth.
