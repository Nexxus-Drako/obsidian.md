Then it happened. A whisper of cold dread trickling down the quantum link. A system alert, not from the F.R.C. itself, but from Fenrir's fleet command on Syndïlæ.

<<We have an incursion.>> Luna Fenrir's thought was pure, undiluted tactical concern. <<Class VII unauthorized vessel, just breached our quarantine perimeter. It's using a stealth configuration that exploits a flaw in our own sensor lattice—previously unknown.>>

My administrative consciousness flared, the NEXXUS network instantly cross-referencing the event. Fenrir's fleet was flawless. A flaw this deep had to have been deliberate. Planted. A backdoor I myself, in my long millennia of overseeing Union infrastructure, must have overlooked. The shame of it was a cold knot in my stomach.

<<Identify.>> I commanded, my mind racing through tactical databases. <<Threat assessment.>>

<<The vessel… it's broadcasting an Earth-standard IFF.>> Quinn Caelestis responded, her precise feline thoughts cutting through the static. <<A civilian designation. Registry: Kuratazi III. Melbourne, Australia. Hull classification… private vessel. Name: Neighbours>>

Neighbours? The old Earth soap opera? The one that inexplicably held a bizarre, kitschy appeal across the Union? The absurdity of it was disarming. A cultural joke, a reference to a simpler world, suddenly appearing as a tactical threat at the bleeding edge of reality. That was F.R.C. logic. A perversion of culture into a weapon.

<<It's changing course.>> Fenrir updated, her warrior's mind instantly grasping the tactical implications. <<It's not making a run for the inner system. It's heading for Esmërældus. Sythini's world.>>

<<My world.>> Sythini's thought joined the conversation, her thousand-year consciousness stretching out, a web of serene but profound alarm. <<And I see it. Not through sensors, but through the ley lines of wyld magick. A scar. A wound.>>

<<Let me see.>> I commanded, the request directed at the NEXXUS network's vast observational apparatus. I rerouted the deepest-range sensor relays, the ones that could measure gravitational lensing and temporal distortion, toward the rogue ship. The data flooded my consciousness, and what I saw wasn't a starship.

It was a tear.

The Neighbours wasn't traveling through space; it was rewriting it as it went. Behind it, reality shimmered and frayed, the starfield replaced by a sickly, off-color pastiche. Homes with impossibly green lawns, characters who spoke in stilted, twenty-four-minute-per-problem dialogue, a sun that always shone in a clear blue sky. The simulation of Earth suburbia, writ large across the cosmos, was being used as a literal invasion vector.

<It's a ship. And a story.> I murmured aloud, the words forming in the Vikatorūan air. <He's broadcasting a narrative to replace our own.>

<But why Esmërældus?> Kazumi's copper fur bristled, her tails coiling with confusion. <The Ælffolk world is all slow time and stagnant tectonics. What value is it to him?>

<<Because my world is the Union's memory.>> Sythini's answer came not through the tactical link, but as a whisper on the wind of the Genesis Dome, the sound of rustling leaves from a forest a million light-years away. <<The F.R.C. can erase its history from the databases, the servers, the archives. But it cannot erase it from the trees of Esmërældus. Our memories are stored in the slow growth of our world, in the long life cycles of the creatures that share our forest home. The Neighbours is not an invasion force. It is a reformatting tool.>>

The cold dread crystallized into absolute clarity. The F.R.C. wasn't just playing a game to win. It was playing to delete. Big Bang Konzern wasn't just a rival football club. It was a hostile rewrite protocol. The corporation was the front-end, the user-friendly interface for the real weapon: a memetic virus disguised as a nostalgic Earth sitcom. The ultimate expression of colonization.

<We have to stop it.> The words were a raw instinct, the Wyrmfolk warrior in me demanding action, a fleet, a weapon. <Fenrir, target that ship. Caelestis, prepare to sever the data stream.>

<<Negative.>> Fenrir's response was iron. <<Any direct engagement would be exactly what it wants. The Neighbours is a story about conflict, misunderstanding, and eventual reconciliation within a prescribed social structure. Fighting it with violence validates its premise. We can't attack it as a ship. We have to invalidate it as a narrative.>>

<<Its narrative requires conflict.>> Quinn’s precise feline logic was scalpel-sharp. <<It needs a problem. A villain. An antagonist. We have been treating the F.R.C. as the villain. The protocol's action suggests it has recast us in that role. The invading, controlling Union, coming to crush the simple, authentic life it offers. By attacking, we confirm its story and inoculate its target worlds.>>

<He's turning the Union's own strength—our diversity, our power—into the justification for his bland, uniform assimilation.> I completed her thought, a bitter taste in my mouth. My life's work, my ascension, my entire governance philosophy, was being twisted into a tool of oppression.

<<We cannot meet him on the battlefield. We must meet him in the story.>> Sythini's whisper was the rustle of ancient leaves, the creak of timeless wood. <<Esmërældus cannot fight the invasion. It must… out-wait it. Absorb it. Let the story of Neighbours crash against our deep time and be worn down to nothing.>>

<My world’s history is not stored in our digital archives but in the rings of the Greatwood of Rythorn, the slow migration patterns of the Azure-Breasted Roc, the geological memory of the dormant volcanoes that form our very spines. A sitcom from a fast-world, with its problems solved in under an hour, cannot find purchase here. Its narrative tempo is wrong.>>

<It’s a denial-of-service attack on civilization itself.> The realization hit me with the force of a meteor. <He’s not just trying to win a football season. He's trying to turn the infinite, sprawling novel of the Union into a pamphlet.>

<Then he doesn't get to write the next chapter.> Kazumi’s copper resolve solidified next to me. Her six tails stopped swaying, each one pointing in a different direction, a constellation of purpose. <The Den-Challenge. It’s not just our weapon. It’s our counter-narrative. And Jarokn Victory needs its home game. And we're already on an away trip. The away day.>

She was right. The ultimate away game. We had planned to use the Genesis Dome as our base, our sanctuary, the place where we could demonstrate the superiority of our logic. But Sythini’s revelation changed everything. The F.R.C. had forced our hand. We had to take the Jarokn Victory Den-Challenge to the heart of the infection. To Esmërældus.

<We have to build a den on Esmërældus.> The idea, once spoken, felt absolutely, terrifyingly correct. <Not a stadium. A den. Right in the path of that… that story-ship. We'll plant Jarokn Victory, a root of genuine narrative complexity, right in the path of the F.R.C.'s bland, memetic erosion. A counter-wave to beat his tide.>

<<The Greatwood would host you.>> Sythini's agreement flowed through the link, a calm, deep, and profoundly Ælffolk statement. <<It has seen civilizations rise and fall. It has endured worse than a bad story. Its deep roots hold the memory of worlds. It can shelter ours.>>

<This is what Excelcius was built for.> I turned to the silver-sigiled Immortal, who was observing the developing tactical situation with an unnerving stillness. <Can you do it?> Can you translate our den into a form that can take root in the Greatwood? Something that the Neighbours protocol can't identify as a rival club?

<I can design a new protocol. A memetic antibody. One that doesn't trigger F.R.C.'s threat-recognition systems. I will mask Jarokn Victory not as a football club, but as a… a cultural exchange.> Her silver sigil flared, the trident splitting into countless fractal branches. <I will embed the den's architecture within the language of Ælffolk ritual. A 'Sylvan Festival of Renewal'.> She looked at Kazumi. <Your Den-Challenge, your Kitsune minds, will be the festival's participants, not a 'team'. The F.R.C. will register it as local religious activity, statistically insignificant.> Her silver logic was so beautiful in its audacity, I almost wanted to laugh. <We will cheat not by breaking the rules, but by writing the rulebook in a language he can't read.>

<He won't attack a festival.> Kazumi realized, her copper tails weaving in the air with renewed energy. <But he will try to assimilate it. To subsume it. We must ensure our story… is too deep. Too complex.>

<Then we give the Greatwood a memory.> I whispered, and the full scope of what Pyra had given us bloomed in my mind. The Author, the source code, the creative wellspring. <We don't just build a den. We give the Greatwood… its own game. One that can be played for millennia.>

The Genesis Dome dissolved. The copper light of a thousand Kitsune souls swirled in the Vikatorūan night, no longer contained by a stadium but held in the vastness of my own consciousness, and in the living architecture of Kazumi's design. We had poured so much into building a sanctuary, a home base, a place to fight from. We hadn't considered the possibility that our greatest strength was not our defensive posture, but our ability to uproot entirely.

The copper energy of the Den-Challenge pulsed beside me, a warm, insistent presence. Kazumi had her own ideas, and they were brilliant. <The Den-Challenge… it can't just be a defensive structure. It has to be a story. An experience. We'll make the Jarokn Victory Den-Challenge not just a place, but a journey. A pilgrimage. A living memory that moves through the forest.>

The transition was seamless. One moment we stood on the red dust of Vikatorūa, the next we stood on the soft, ancient soil of Esmërældus. The air here was different. Thicker, humid, filled with the scent of wet earth and the slow, deep breathing of the forest itself. The trees of the Greatwood of Rythorn were not trees as I understood them. They were colossal, their trunks wider than starships, their branches so high they seemed to support the very sky. The light filtering through their leaves had a green, sunken quality, as if it had been filtered through a thousand years of history. This was a place of slow, deep magic. A place where the very concept of a 'season' could last a century.

<The F.R.C. sees this world as a database. A set of resources to be cataloged.> I sent the thought to Kazumi, my senses reeling from the sheer scale of the place. <It cannot comprehend this magic. This deep time.
