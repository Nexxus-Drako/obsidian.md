## ESTIMATED TOKEN COSTS

**Memory Block:** ~1,200 tokens (relatively lean for world-building density)
**Each Author's Note:** ~150-300 tokens (depends on specificity)
**Each Character Lorebook Entry:** ~300-500 tokens
**All 15 Lorebook Entries:** ~5,000-7,500 tokens (activate only what you need)

**Recommended Minimal Setup:**
- Memory: ~1,200 tokens
- Author's Note: ~200 tokens
- 3-4 Active Lorebook entries: ~1,200 tokens
- **Total overhead:** ~2,600 tokens for full world-building + immediate story generation

---

## TONE CONSISTENCY MAINTENANCE

The system is designed to self-correct around these anchors:

- **Australian directness** in dialogue (especially Kazumi)
- **Defiant humor** treating cosmic stakes lightly
- **Metahumorous self-awareness** (characters knowing they're in a story)
- **Angle bracket transmission** for consciousness-to-consciousness
- **Game-design language** as explanatory framework
- **Short/long sentence contrast** (intensity vs. reflection)
- **Warmth mixed with scale** (intimate + cosmic simultaneously)

If the AI drifts from tone, it's usually because:
1. Author's Note is too generic (select more specific block)
2. Memory is compressed too much (use full version)
3. Wrong Lorebook entries active (check character consistency)
4. Prompt lacks contextual anchoring (start with provided generation prompts)

## BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

✓ **DO:**
- Keep Memory block constant across entire story
- Update Author's Note for each scene type change
- Activate only Lorebook entries relevant to current scene
- Use angle brackets correctly for consciousness transmission
- Reference games/systems as explanatory frameworks
- Balance intimate character detail with cosmic scope
- Include historical trauma/complexity
- Show multiple valid frameworks coexisting

✗ **DON'T:**
- Compress or paraphrase Memory block
- Use generic Author's Note for specialized scenes
- Activate all 15 Lorebook entries simultaneously (wastes tokens)
- Oversimplify species/world details
- Remove cultural distinctiveness in favor of uniformity
- Shy away from trauma/injustice in history
- Force resolution—Union is perpetually becoming
- Ignore the metahumorous fourth-wall awareness

## NEXT STEPS FOR YOUR USAGE

1. **Start New Story:** Copy Memory + select Author's Note → Generate opening

2. **Scene Transition:** Update Author's Note, enable/disable Lorebook entries per scene needs

3. **Tone Drift:** Check Troubleshooting Quick Fix Table in NovelAI-Copy-Paste-Ready.md

4. **Add New Scenes:** Reference Character Voice Markers for consistency

5. **Long-Form Story:** Periodically review Memory to ensure world-building stays coherent

6. **Expand Lorebook:** Can add new entries following the format from Immortal-Six-Lorebook.md

## CHARACTER VOICE QUICK REFERENCE (Copy for Generation)

Need to remind AI of voice patterns? Include these in your prompt or Author's Note:

- **Luna:** "Luna's strategic warmth balanced system optimization with genuine affection, her thoughts frequently interrupted by NEXXUS's superintelligent counterpoint."

- **Kazumi:** "Kazumi's Australian accent cut through formality like copper through darkness. She thought in terms of collective welfare and den solidarity."

- **Sythini:** "Sythini perceived governance decisions across centuries, her ancient mind patient where others rushed."

- **Fenrir:** "Fenrir's direct clarity cut through diplomatic nuance—she named truths others avoided, her warrior's mind oriented toward protection."

- **Quinn:** "Quinn's feline precision balanced analytical rigor with genuine empathetic connection; she saw clearly and cared deeply."

- **Excelcius:** "Excelcius's bureaucratic logic was occasionally interrupted by dry humor born from millennia of witnessing civilizational cycles."

- **Pyra:** "Pyra Drake treated reality-writing like debugging—darkly funny, exhausted, defiant against the weight of authorship."

## KNOWN STRENGTHS OF THIS SETUP

✓ Maintains complex multi-species worldbuilding without overwhelming AI
✓ Preserves character relationships and partnerships across dimensions
✓ Grounds cosmic scale in intimate character detail
✓ Supports metahumorous fourth-wall awareness naturally
✓ Enables narrative-as-reality mechanic without confusion
✓ Balances technical detail with philosophical depth
✓ Allows multiple valid frameworks/consciousness types to coexist
✓ Supports defiant-humor tone even in serious scenes

---

## KNOWN CHALLENGING AREAS

⚠ Maintaining "narrative literally shapes reality" concept (may need prompt reinforcement)
⚠ Keeping distributed consciousness distinct from merged consciousness clear
⚠ Sustaining tension between "utopian ideals" and "imperial systems" simultaneously
⚠ Preventing simplification of Kitsune reproductive ethics complexity
⚠ Maintaining F.R.C. as narrative threat (not just external antagonist)
⚠ Keeping post-scarcity economics coherent while showing meaning-creation focus
⚠ Balancing defiant humor with genuine emotional weight

**Solutions:** Reference Author's Note regularly, use specific prompts, enable relevant Lorebook entries for these concepts

## SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

If generation results:

**Are too generic/lacking character voice:**
→ Update Author's Note with more specific scene type block

**Are losing world-building coherence:**
→ Check Memory is full, not compressed; verify Lorebook entries activated

**Show character inconsistency:**
→ Reference Character Voice Quick Reference section, enable correct Lorebook entry

**Lose defiant humor tone:**
→ Add "darkly humorous" emphasis to Author's Note

**Break fourth-wall awkwardly:**
→ It's supposed to happen—verify it's emerging naturally from character perspective, not being forced

**Shift to wrong consciousness perspective:**
→ Check angle bracket usage in generation prompt; ensure angle brackets present for thought transmission
