## ONE FINAL TIP

The defiant, darkly humorous tone of this universe comes alive through:
1. **Memory giving AI permission** to reference games, narrative theory, and systems thinking
2. **Author's Note reinforcing** that metahumor and cosmic stakes coexist
3. **Character Lorebook entries showing** how each personality handles absurdity with different approaches
4. **Your generation prompts starting** from emotionally resonant moments (see Starting Prompts in Copy-Paste file)

The AI will lean into defiance and humor naturally once it understands the world treats narrative as fundamental reality and characters as authors of their own stories.
