The habitation dome of Praxis Station hung suspended above Itavrnai V, and Luna Darke could feel the subtle hum of the station's stabilizers through her gaming rig as she worked on the final section of her World Games Association registration form. It was a warm afternoon in the observation quarter, where the permanent spaceport sprawled below like a geometric flower—ships arriving and departing in the choreographed dance that had defined the Itavran Union's character since its founding.

Luna was no stranger to interstellar administration, though she'd never expected to sit at a desk filling out official paperwork. For 120-some years, she'd been content to exist within the margins of the Union—a streamer, a game developer, a voice in the dark corners of the gaming community who'd built something special with her chosen family scattered across five worlds. But with the recent deployment of the nanotech prevention system—tiny drones woven through the fabric of Itavran biology itself—something had shifted. The Union's leadership recognized that their most valuable asset wasn't just the technology keeping them alive forever, nor the economic surplus that made traditional scarcity obsolete. It was community. It was play. It was the connections forged through competition and cooperation, through games.

The Itavran Union was unlike anything humanity's ancient nation-states could have conceived. When the boundary between Itavra Prime, Vyktoria's orbital colonies, the Kalyon research stations, and the far systems had begun to blur—when the five species of the Itavrnai system chose not merely to coexist but to thrive as a unified polity—they hadn't needed a constitution written in abstract principle. They needed a binding force, something that transcended the biological differences that might otherwise have created fracture lines. That force turned out to be friendship, competition, and games.

Luna set down her coffee—real, grown in one of the biosphere gardens, not synthesized—and reviewed the form once more. Where Umbra Southgate had been writing as an Earth-bound neo-nation seeking legitimacy within a declining political system, Luna was writing as something different: a steward of gaming culture for an off-world civilization where fun had become existential rather than frivolous.

​

The shift from Nexxus Drako's streaming handle to her current brand identity had been gradual. For decades, she'd operated under that name, developing indie titles, broadcasting marathons, building a following that spanned the settlements and research stations of the Itavran Union. Her games were modest—passion projects coded in collaboration with AI design partners, streamed across the Itavran Network to audiences hungry for new content. But they were _hers_, and they carried something authentic that the endlessly proliferating computer-generated entertainment could never quite replicate: the fingerprint of human (and hybrid, and uplifted) creativity.

Nexxus Drako's most beloved project was still _Football Club Creator_—a passion letter to _Let's Make a Soccer Team!_, that ancient PlayStation 2 game from Earth's past. She'd expanded it exponentially, adding layers of micromanagement that ranged from stadium seating arrangements to the psychology of youth academy recruitment. The game lived in real-time, mirroring the 32-week seasons that governed Itavran competitive play, with the ability to shift into accelerated time during administrative phases. Thousands of players maintained clubs across the Itavran Circuit, a decentralized pyramid that spanned all five settled worlds, connecting habitats and research stations in a network of friendly rivalry.

But Nexxus Drako had become something else too—a symbol of the old internet, of streamers and VTubers and parasocial relationships. Luna Darke was what came after. Luna was a founder of the _Itavran Gaming Collective_—not a neo-nation in the old Earth sense, but something more fluid, more essential. It was an association of players, creators, and developers whose primary citizenship was to excellence in competitive play. Their headquarters existed as a distributed entity: offices on Itavra Prime, broadcast studios in the Vyktoria Orbitals, research labs on Kalyon Seven, with minor nodes threaded through the outer settlements.

The Union itself—the larger Itavran political structure—didn't regulate games the way the ancient United Nations had regulated everything. The Union facilitated. It provided the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the equitable access systems that made sure a child in the deepest mining colony had the same connection speed as a noble on Itavra Prime. The World Games Association, by contrast, was the meritocratic engine. It was the arbiter of skill, the keeper of rankings, the architect of tournaments that pitted millions of competitors against each other in moments of pure, distilled play.

Luna had been chosen—or had volunteered, the distinction was blurry in a society where ambition and leisure had become nearly synonymous—to serve as the collective's representative to the WGA's formal structure. Not as a "Queen" in any feudal sense. The Itavran Union had left all of that theatrical nationalism behind. Luna was a Director, an Architect, a voice among many. But she was the one signing the papers today.

She'd spent the morning reviewing the technical specifications of how the Collective would integrate with the WGA's ranking algorithms. The system was elegant: skill ratings floated on an exponential scale, with 1.0 representing baseline human competence and the scale extending upward into the theoretical realms where the best players alive—professionals who had dedicated centuries to mastering their chosen disciplines—pushed against the limits of what was possible. Luna herself held a 4.7 in _Football Club Creator_, a rank achieved through obsessive attention to the game's Byzantine subsystems. It wasn't the highest—that honor belonged to a handful of savant-tier players who'd been playing since the game's inception—but it placed her in the top percentile of the billions of competitors across the Itavran Union and its affiliated settlements.

What made her rank interesting wasn't the number itself, but what it represented: a human being (mostly human, with some elective enhancements most people didn't talk about) who had chosen to spend significant fractions of their infinite life becoming exceptionally good at something playful. In a civilization where death had become an abstraction and suffering a distant memory, where the nanotech drones now wove through every Itavran's cellular structure preventing injury and illness before it could manifest, that choice to pursue mastery for its own sake felt revolutionary.

​

The Collective's townhall—a real-time governance interface distributed across the Union's network—had been buzzing with activity for the past three hours. Since Luna had submitted the WGA application, the messages had flowed like a tide: congratulations from longtime followers, strategy discussions about how the Collective would approach competitive play, wild speculation about what the partnership would mean for the broader gaming culture of the Itavran Union.

Vyktory Gaming, the Collective's formal gaming arm, had once been a micronation in its own right, back when such things still made sense in Earth's declining political order. Now it was something more hybrid: a gaming clan, an esports organization, a creative cooperative, and a philosophical statement all at once. The ethos was simple: camaraderie and competition united as one identity. Unlike the cutthroat hierarchies of Earth's ancient sports leagues, Vyktory didn't function on scarcity. There was no salary cap, no draft system, no mechanism of artificial constraint designed to create parity. Instead, the system was designed around flourishing: players were supported to become as good as they possibly could be, and that competitive excellence fed back into the broader community. A young player could watch Luna's _Football Club Creator_ streams and learn not just the mechanics of the game, but the philosophy of how to think about systems, optimization, and long-term strategy. That young player could then build on that knowledge, push further, and eventually become a teacher to the next generation.

This was where the Itavran Union's founding ethos diverged most sharply from Earth's old models. Resources weren't scarce. Attention wasn't limited to a finite pool. The Union's economy had evolved beyond scarcity into something the economists called "post-rarity abundance management"—essentially, a system that tracked time and effort rather than currency, where participation in meaningful work generated the "credits" needed to access resources. Games didn't compete with that system; they were that system. Every minute spent in competitive play, every decision made within a game's ruleset, every achievement unlocked contributed to a player's standing in the vast network of reputation and skill that the WGA maintained.

Luna's coffee had gone cold. She opened _Football Club Creator_ and logged into her primary club: AFC Luna, a team she'd been managing for 47 years. They were currently 8th in the World League 1 standings, which meant they were ranked somewhere in the top few million clubs across all 30 tiers of the Itavran pyramid. The season was 22 weeks in, with 10 weeks remaining before the transition into the "silly season" friendly competitions and the Immortal Rules tournaments that defined the latter half of Itavran sporting calendar.

One of her players—a striker named Asha, randomly generated by the game's talent system but physically modeled after a real player Luna had met on Kalyon Station—was about to complete a contract negotiation. Luna had decided to increase Asha's wages by 15 percent, a decision that would ripple through the club's financial structure and require adjustments to the training facilities. She pulled up the three-dimensional architectural view of AFC Luna's clubhouse and began sketching out an expansion to the meditation gardens. This was the kind of work that occupied her between matches: the endless optimization, the impossible pursuit of perfection in systems designed never to reach it.

It was, she reflected, a perfect hobby for someone with infinite life ahead of them.

​

The nanotech systems had gone live exactly 8 days, 14 hours, and 23 minutes ago. Luna remembered the day clearly because it had been the impetus for her and the Collective's leadership to finally take the plunge into formal WGA recognition. For two centuries—since the moment in 2026 when humans had mysteriously stopped dying—the Itavran Union and its peoples had lived with a kind of hovering anxiety. Pain was gone, illness was eliminated, fatal injuries healed at rates that approached the miraculous. But there was still the rare catastrophe, the accident that could damage the brainstem or sever the connection between mind and body in ways that medicine, even medicine advanced by two hundred years, struggled to fully repair.

The nanotech solution was elegant and slightly unsettling. Microscopic drones, woven through every Itavran citizen's body in a biological network, could sense damage before it occurred and trigger localized healing responses. A fall that should have shattered a bone instead produced a light bruise, the nanotech having reinforced the structure microseconds before impact. An illness contracted from the environment would be suppressed before it reached infectious levels. In essence, the nanotech made the Itavrans into what the philosophers had started calling "minor gods"—not immortal in the absolute sense (there were still theoretical scenarios that could overwhelm even the nanotech network), but functionally immune to the concerns that had once dominated human existence.

The deployment had freed something in the culture. People had been living carefully for two centuries, aware at some level that catastrophe was still theoretically possible. With that final thread of mortality cut, behavior changed. People took more risks. They pursued more ambitious projects. They played harder.

Luna had felt it immediately in the Collective's community. The energy level had spiked. Players had become more aggressive in their competitive approach. Streamers had extended their marathon sessions, pushing for new skill thresholds now that the lingering fear of burnout-related health complications had dissolved. Game developers—the human ones, working alongside AI partners—had begun pitching more ambitious projects, wild ideas that would have seemed reckless just weeks before.

The WGA registration felt like the natural culmination of this energy release. The Itavran Gaming Collective wasn't just seeking recognition; it was claiming a place in the formal structure of the Union's competitive landscape. It was saying: _This is what we do. This is who we are. We are gamers._

​

As evening fell on Praxis Station, Luna finished her registration form and submitted it through the Itavran Network. The form itself was just a formality—the bulk of the data would be pulled automatically from the Collective's governance system, a sophisticated blockchain-based architecture that managed membership, reputation, finances, and competitive records across the distributed network. Unlike Earth's ancient cryptocurrencies, which had been designed as speculative financial instruments, the Itavran blockchain served a different function. It was a tool for coordinating collective action across worlds, a shared ledger of truth that no individual could corrupt or falsify.

The response came within minutes: accepted, with provisional tournament seeding that would place the Itavran Gaming Collective in the upper-mid tiers of the WGA's pyramid. Luna smiled at the screen, then opened her personal streaming client and began recording a brief announcement for the Collective's channels.

"Hey, everyone," she began, her voice settling into the familiar cadence that had defined her broadcasts for decades. "We're in. As of about 30 seconds ago, the Itavran Gaming Collective is officially recognized by the World Games Association. We're registered, we're seeded, and starting next season, we're going to have a formal presence in the WGA tournament structure."

She let the weight of that statement settle for a moment, then continued. "This doesn't change who we are or what we do. We're still the same community we've always been—friends and competitors, players and creators, building something beautiful in the margins of the Itavran Union. But now we get to do it on a bigger stage. And that's exciting. That's really exciting."

The stream metrics climbed as the feed distributed across the Itavran Network. Across five worlds and a hundred habitats, thousands of gamers received the notification, watched Luna's announcement, and felt the subtle thrill of belonging to something that mattered.

After the stream ended, Luna set down her equipment and looked out through the observation dome at the spaceport below. Ships came and went in their geometric patterns. The Itavran Union turned its slow rotations around its five settled worlds, 8.2 billion people living in a civilization of abundance where the primary constraint was no longer survival but meaning. Games—sports and video games and board games and everything in between—had become the primary mechanism through which that meaning was created and shared.

She thought about Nexxus Drako, the streamer and developer who had existed decades ago, building small projects in the margins. That version of Luna had been content with a small community, with modest tools, with the knowledge that she was creating something personal. Luna Darke, Director of the Itavran Gaming Collective, carried that same heart, but now it beat within a larger structure, a formal recognition, a place at the table of the Union's grand competitive architecture.

Tomorrow, she would return to _Football Club Creator_ and continue the endless work of optimization and system design. She would stream for her followers. She would mentor younger developers. She would spend whatever fraction of her infinite life she'd chosen to dedicate to games, doing exactly what she'd been doing for nearly two centuries: building communities, crafting systems, and proving that play—real, deep, serious play—was the most important work the Itavran Union had ever undertaken.

The nanotech drones hummed silently through her body, keeping her safe, healthy, and alive for all the centuries of games yet to come.

For now, though, she headed home to her apartment and made herself a meal—real food, grown in the Union's biosphere gardens, not synthesized or produced by some automated system. She ate slowly, savoring it, then settled into her gaming chair with _Football Club Creator_ queued up.

There was always more work to do on the meditation gardens.
