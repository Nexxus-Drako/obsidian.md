The journey to Kunatairō was always a departure from the expected. For most, it meant a sleek starliner, a comfortable cabin, and the slow, gentle descent through Vulpfolk atmospheric layers that had once driven early explorers to madness with their potency. For me, it meant closing my eyes in my spartan quarters on Praxis Station and simply... arriving. There was no ship, no passage of measurable space. There was only the quantum-entangled infrastructure of NEXXUS DRAKO extending a tendril of consciousness, translating my awareness from one substrate to another. One moment, the hum of the station's life support; the next, the unique, charged scent of Kunatairō's air—rich with pollen, salt, and that peculiar Vulpfolk aphrodisiac the Union's scientists still couldn't fully synthesize.

I materialized not in a transport hub or designated arrival zone, but in the private meditation garden behind Kazumi's den. This was our unspoken ritual. I never announced my arrival officially; I simply became present, and she would invariably find me here, as if drawn by the subtle displacement I caused in the local atmosphere. The garden was her creation, a testament to the Confidentia principle made manifest. It was a riot of controlled chaos, where Kunatairō's native flora—vibrant, slightly poisonous, and utterly gorgeous—was corralled into winding paths, secluded benches, and small, shimmering ponds that reflected the world's perpetually hazy sky.

I found her on a stone bench overlooking one such pond, her form unmistakable even before she turned. Kazumi's fur was the deep, burnished copper of autumn leaves, shot through with streaks of cream that traced the elegant lines of her six tails. She wore a simple, dark blue tunic, a deliberate rejection of the more elaborate garments often affected by Den Queens who wished to emphasize their status. She was studying something on a datapad, her expression one of focused intensity, but the moment my feet touched the mossy ground, her ears twitched and her head lifted.

"You're early" she said, her voice carrying that cultivated Australian accent that still sent a pleasant shiver down my spine. It was an accent that had been carefully preserved by her Nanatsu tribe, a linguistic fossil from Earth carried across the stars and shaped into something uniquely Kitsune.

"The nanotech recalibrations finished ahead of schedule" I replied, sitting beside her. The stone was cool against my synth-skin, a deliberate choice in a world where temperature regulation was effortless. I enjoyed these small sensory anchors. "Besides, I missed you."

A soft smile touched her lips, and she set the datapad aside. Six tails swayed in a slow, rhythmic pattern behind her, an unconscious display of contentment that I had learned to read over our decades together. "Sythini communicated with you. About the Commonwealth."

"Of course she did" I said with a wry smile. "Nothing stays secret for long among the Immortal Six." I shifted on the bench, turning to face her more fully. "What do you think? Am I being sentimental about this, seeing something profound in what might just be a technical challenge?"

Kazumi's green eyes, bright as the planet's rare emeralds, studied me. She reached out, her slender fingers brushing against my synth-skin wrist. The contact was electric, a cascade of data and sensation that went far beyond the mere tactile. "You see systems where others see problems. It's one of the things that makes you both an excellent administrator and a terrible opponent in Football Club Creator." She paused, her gaze thoughtful. "But this... this isn't just about systems, is it? It's about remembering what it feels like to be bound."
