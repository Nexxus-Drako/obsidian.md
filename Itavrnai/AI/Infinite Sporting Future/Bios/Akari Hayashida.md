### **Akari Hayashida (Kitsune Researcher)**

**Species:** Kitsune (six tails; silver-tipped fur distinctive among her peers)

**Role:** Researcher developing quantification methods for Kitsune distributed cognition; team member on probe investigation

**Key Characteristics:**
- Young compared to immortal standards; represents next generation of Kitsune scholars
- Particularly skilled at collaborative problem-solving within Den Challenge framework
- Works with Luna on mathematical models translating distributed cognition into observable patterns
- Brings practical expertise in how non-technological consciousness can process complex information
- Actively engaged in multi-paradigm research, comfortable bridging Kitsune cognitive models with Union's quantum frameworks

**Significance:** Represents how younger Kitsunes educated in progressive dens like Aikawa are positioned to become bridges between traditional species-specific strengths and Union-wide collaborative frameworks. On the probe team, her work will demonstrate how consciousness itself—without technological mediation—might interface with the anomaly.
