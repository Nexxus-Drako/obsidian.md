Darkness, then—awareness returning not as gentle waking but as violent reassembly. My consciousness slammed back into my medbay body like a physical impact. The diagnostic displays beside my bed screamed warnings across multiple species' biological parameters. Kazumi and Quinn stood over me, their expressions masks of professional concern that couldn't entirely hide their alarm.

<The anomaly is speaking to you directly now.> Quinn transmitted, her Felidfolk precision strained with emotion. <Through the very infrastructure of your being.>

<Not speaking.> I managed, my thoughts feeling fragmented and foreign in my own mind. <Mocking. Undermining the foundation of what I am.>

<We observed the transmission patterns as they overwhelmed your systems.> Kazumi added, her consciousness flowing with concern that barely masked deeper fear.
