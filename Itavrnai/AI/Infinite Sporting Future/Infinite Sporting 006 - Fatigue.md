<Fatigue.> The transmission from Luna Fenrir carried the characteristic roughness of Wülffolk consciousness, direct and uncompromising. <A warrior's body recognizes when the battle extends beyond physical realm.> Her massive presence filled the sacred space, her midnight snow fur seeming to absorb the ambient light as if storing it for future use. Beside her, Quinn Caelestis appeared as slender precision in gold and black, her green eyes already scanning the assembled group with analytical intensity.

<Nanotech systems have detected unusual energy fluctuations across Union infrastructure.> Quinn transmitted, her consciousness displaying the Felidfolk capacity for precise observation even amid metaphysical uncertainty. <Not attacks on our systems but responses to our observation of the anomaly—as if reality itself is recoiling from our gaze.>

Sythini Rythorn arrived with her characteristic patience, her thousand-year perspective immediately contextualizing our current concerns within broader temporal patterns. <The progenitors established this sacred space as protection against cosmic disturbances. That we need to convene here suggests the anomaly represents not merely physical phenomenon but metaphysical intrusion.>

Her consciousness carried the measured wisdom of someone who had witnessed centuries of Union evolution and understood that authentic transformation occurred across temporal scales that frustrated immediate resolution. I felt grateful for her presence—her ability to maintain clarity without rushing toward solutions created space for deeper understanding.

<The anomaly's effects on my own consciousness suggest it operates on principles that interact directly with awareness itself.> I transmitted, allowing my experience of unusual fatigue to inform the group. <Not through technological interface but through direct engagement with whatever cognitive framework the observer brings to the encounter.>

<As different musical instruments respond differently to the same acoustic space.> Sythini observed, her Ælffolk perspective immediately grasping the metaphor. <Each producing distinctive resonance based on its material properties and design rather than merely reflecting the environment uniformly.>

<The probe crew will need to develop capacity for shifting between cognitive frameworks deliberately.> I continued, my consciousness flowing through implications that extended far beyond the immediate mission. <Not merely operating multiple technological systems but transforming their own consciousness to match each paradigm.>

<A warrior must sometimes fight with unfamiliar weapons.> Luna Fenrir transmitted, her consciousness displaying the Wülffolk understanding that strength emerges from adapting to constraints rather than merely overcoming them. <But this requires more than technical training—it requires mental flexibility that transcends ordinary preparation.>

The assembled consciousness in Origin Hall shifted as another presence joined our gathering. Kazumi had not been summoned through the quantum-entangled networks reserved for Immortals, yet her presence manifested clearly in the sacred space—a testament to the profound connection between our minds that transcended ordinary communication protocols. Her copper fur with cream-colored streaks seemed to catch and hold the ambient light of Origin Hall, her six tails moving in patterns that expressed concepts exceeding linguistic capacity.

<The Commonwealth's sequential processing systems may serve as cognitive anchors.> Kazumi transmitted, her awareness immediately connecting to the deeper patterns we were discussing. <Their limitations create focus rather than merely restricting capacity—concentrating consciousness through narrow pathways that resist dispersal by quantum interference.>

Quinn's green eyes narrowed with analytical intensity, her Felidfolk capacity for rigorous observation immediately grasping the implications. <The anomaly may be less an external phenomenon than a mirror—reflecting back the cognitive framework through which we attempt to perceive it.>

<Then the probe's mission transforms from observation to intentional engagement.> I concluded, feeling the pieces finally click into place. <Not merely studying the anomaly but deliberately shifting between cognitive approaches to observe how our own consciousness shapes what we perceive.>

The sacred space of Origin Hall seemed to pulse with understanding as this recognition settled among the assembled leaders. Suddenly, and violently, I blacked out.
