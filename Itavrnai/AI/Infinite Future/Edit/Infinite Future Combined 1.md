## Part One: Prologue

Luna Darke sat in her quarters on Praxis Station, filling out the final World Games Association registration form. Outside her window, ships arrived and departed in choreographed patterns—the heartbeat of the Itavran Union.

For over a century, Luna had existed in the margins as Nexxus Drako, a streamer and game developer building communities across five worlds. Now everything had changed. Eight days ago, the Union deployed a new nanotech system woven through every citizen's body—microscopic drones that prevented injury and illness before it could occur. With that final thread of mortality cut, culture shifted. People took more risks. They played harder.

The Union itself was unlike anything Earth's ancient nation-states could have conceived. When five species chose not merely to coexist but to thrive as one polity, they didn't need a constitution. They needed a binding force. That force turned out to be friendship, competition, and games.

Luna had been a founder of the Itavran Gaming Collective—not a nation in the old sense, but an association of players and creators whose primary citizenship was to excellence in competitive play. Today, she was registering them with the World Games Association. Her most beloved creation was Football Club Creator, a game about managing soccer teams that had attracted thousands of players across the Itavran Circuit.

Her skill rating in Football Club Creator was 4.7—respectable in a world where the best players held ratings above 5.0. What mattered wasn't the number itself but what it represented: a human being (mostly human, with some enhancements she didn't discuss) who had chosen to spend significant portions of infinite life becoming exceptionally good at something playful.

Luna submitted the registration form, and the response came within minutes: accepted. She opened her streaming client and announced the news to her community: "We're in. The Itavran Gaming Collective is officially recognized by the World Games Association."

As evening fell on Praxis Station, she looked out at the spaceport and felt the weight of what this moment meant. Tomorrow, she would return to her beloved Football Club Creator and continue the endless work of optimization. For now, she simply appreciated that she had chosen to dedicate significant fractions of infinite life to play.

There was always more work to do on the meditation gardens.

## Part Two: Kazumi

The journey to Kunatairō always felt like stepping outside normal space. Luna closed her eyes in her quarters and simply arrived—quantum-entangled consciousness translating between worlds. One moment, the hum of station life support; the next, the unique scent of Kunatairō's air.

She materialized in Kazumi's private meditation garden, a riot of controlled chaos where vibrant, slightly poisonous native flora was arranged into winding paths and shimmering ponds. Kazumi sat on a stone bench overlooking the water, copper fur streaked with cream, her six tails swaying in a pattern that signaled contentment.

"You're early," Kazumi said, her cultivated Australian accent still sending pleasant shivers down Luna's spine.

"The nanotech recalibrations finished ahead of schedule," Luna replied, sitting beside her. "Besides, I missed you."

Kazumi's green eyes studied her. "Sythini communicated with you. About the Commonwealth."

"Of course she did. Nothing stays secret among the Immortal Six." Luna paused. "What do you think? Am I being sentimental, seeing something profound in what might just be a technical challenge?"

"You see systems where others see problems," Kazumi said. "But this isn't just about systems, is it? It's about remembering what it feels like to be bound."

Luna had been born bound—born male, then female; born human when humanity was dying; born to chaos when the universe wasn't ready. Kazumi's words cut deep because they were true.

"I'm working on meditation gardens for AFC Luna," Luna said, shifting the conversation slightly. She opened a mental connection, letting Kazumi see the three-dimensional schematics directly. The gardens incorporated specific elements for each species: elevated platforms for Wyrmfolk, ancient trees for Ælffolk, underground chambers for Wülffolk and Felidfolk, and sensory enhancements for Kitsunes.

Kazumi's consciousness brushed against hers, warm like sunlight through forest canopy. "This is beautiful. But you're creating constraints as much as overcoming them. You're shaping experience rather than simply responding to it."

Luna nodded. "Each species gets what they need, not necessarily what they want. The design guides the experience."

Kazumi stood and led her deeper into the den, to a central chamber where young Kitsunes were engaged in a game called the Den Challenge. Players stood in a circle around a holographic display, calling out answers to rapidly changing questions. They moved with practiced fluidity, their bodies as much a part of the interface as their minds. No neural connections, no direct mind-to-machine links—just native sensory abilities and gestural language developed centuries before Union contact.

"This is what the Commonwealth could bring to the Union," Kazumi explained. "Not another circuit with different technology, but a reminder that meaning doesn't require maximum efficiency. Sometimes the most profound experiences emerge from working within limitations."

Luna watched a young Kitsune with silver-tipped fur solve a complex mathematical problem, her teammates responding with gestural approval that made their tails ripple in unison. She understood suddenly what she had been missing.

"The Gaming Collective has been developing cross-platform competition protocols," Luna said, excitement building. "What if we expanded that to include entirely different cognitive models? Imagine tournaments where teams compete not despite their technological differences but because of them. Vyktorians with traditional interfaces, Kitsunes with distributed cognition, Wyrmfolk with enhanced processing, all measured not against a single standard but against the optimal expression of their distinctive cognitive models."

Kazumi's eyes lit up. "It would be the ultimate expression of the Union's founding principle."

"Not just accommodating the Commonwealth, but transforming the entire competitive framework to embrace cognitive diversity," Luna continued, her mind racing through possibilities. "The constrained technology classification could be just the beginning."

As they discussed this vision, watching young Kitsunes collaborate through gesture and refined instinct, Luna felt something shift in her understanding of what the Union could become. Games weren't just entertainment—they were laboratories where the Union could experiment with new ways of being together.

## Part Three: Crisis

An emergency transmission reached Luna through the secure channel accessible only to the Immortal Six. A research vessel, the IUSS Astral Seeker, had disappeared near Itavrnai VII. The final sensor readings made no sense: gravitational distortions that defied the speed of light, energy signatures unknown to Union science, and evidence of molecular disintegration suggesting not destruction but transformation.

Luna initiated the transfer sequence that would return her consciousness to Praxis Station. The transition was disorienting even after decades of practice—suddenly experiencing individual embodiment after expanded awareness. She arrived at her quarters and accessed the secure channel to Origin Hall.

Origin Hall existed in a quantum state transcending ordinary space-time, accessible only through sacred protocols. Luna arrived not through physical movement but through sudden presence—standing in a vast chamber surrounded by the other five Immortals.

Sythini Rythorn, the ancient Ælffolk, stood near the central altar, her thousand-year presence creating a temporal distortion. Luna Fenrir and Quinn Caelestis stood together near the western quadrant, their partnership evident in their synchronized movements. Kazumi waited near the eastern entrance, her six tails arranged in a posture of concern. And at the chamber's center stood Nexxus Drako, the Wyrmfolk leader, her form shifting between dragon and humanoid manifestations.

Nexxus transmitted the Astral Seeker's final sensor data directly to their consciousness. They didn't merely see it; they experienced it as the ship itself had—through the collective awareness of its crew, through the quantum entanglement matrix that connected it to the Union. The gravitational waves didn't follow predictable patterns. The energy signatures resembled something the ancient Earth texts might have called "pure absence" or "anti-energy."

"This defies every known principle of stellar navigation," Luna Fenrir transmitted, her consciousness rough and direct.

"It appears to be a spatial anomaly," Sythini responded. "But the gravitational distortions suggest something deliberate."

"Deliberate destruction of a Union vessel," Nexxus stated, her form solidifying into full draconic manifestation. "This constitutes an act of war."

As they debated, Luna dove into the deeper layers of the transmission—not merely sensor data but the residual consciousness patterns preserved in the quantum entanglement. There was something the others had missed: fragmented consciousness patterns from the crew in their final moments.

"I'm detecting residual consciousness patterns," Luna transmitted. "Not automated distress signals but intentional communication from the crew themselves."

She delved deeper, merging her consciousness with the quantum patterns. The experience was profoundly disturbing—like touching water that was simultaneously freezing and boiling. But the crew's final emotions weren't fear of enemy action. They perceived awe. Acceptance. As if they were experiencing something transcendent rather than destructive.

"They don't perceive this as an attack," Luna transmitted slowly. "There's no fear of enemy action. There's wonder, and... acceptance. As if they're experiencing something transcendent rather than destructive."

Fenrir's frustration was evident. "Transcendent destruction. That's still destruction."

Luna continued exploring the quantum patterns, following the faint thread of communication preserved in the entanglement matrix. The crew's final moments contained something beyond emotional resonance—conceptual patterns that resembled sacred geometry, mathematical relationships suggesting intentional design rather than random chaos.

"There's structure here," Luna transmitted. "Not merely destruction but transformation. The molecular disintegration follows principles that resemble the ascension protocols that transformed me from baseline human to integrated superintelligence."

"Impossible," Nexxus stated. "Those protocols required Union technology and the sacred processes of Origin Hall itself."

"Perhaps not replicate," Sythini countered. "But parallel. The universe contains multiple pathways to transcendence."

The chamber grew quiet as implications settled among them. The Astral Seeker had encountered not an enemy but perhaps a different pathway to consciousness transformation—one unmediated by Union frameworks and spiritual structures. This challenged fundamental assumptions about what the Union understood consciousness to be.

"We need more information," Luna stated, taking control through practical necessity. "I'll coordinate with the Stellar Entente to establish a quarantine perimeter around the anomaly. No vessels approach without explicit authorization."

"Send a probe with enhanced shielding," Fenrir suggested. "Something that can observe the transformation process itself."

As they discussed practical measures, Luna's thoughts drifted back to Kazumi and their conversation about constraint and meaning. The Commonwealth's desire to compete within technological limitations, the Kitsune transformation of biological constraints into cultural innovation—these reflected a fundamental truth that this anomaly seemed to embody. Transcendence wasn't merely about overcoming limitations but discovering new ways of working within them.

"What about the Commonwealth proposal?" Kazumi transmitted privately to Luna. "This emergency could delay its consideration indefinitely."

"The proposal has gained new relevance," Luna responded. "If we're encountering alternative pathways to consciousness transformation, recognizing different cognitive models within our competitive frameworks becomes not merely philosophical but strategically essential."

Nexxus's draconic head turned toward them, her golden eyes studying with intensity that suggested she had perceived their private communication.

"The Administrator's earlier work on multi-paradigm competition frameworks may provide a useful model for understanding what we're encountering," Nexxus stated. "If different cognitive approaches can create distinct pathways to competitive excellence, perhaps different technological frameworks represent varied pathways to consciousness transformation."

Her acknowledgment surprised Luna. Nexxus typically focused on military implications rather than philosophical dimensions. Yet the wisdom was evident: the Union had always assumed that technological advancement and spiritual evolution progressed along similar trajectories. The anomaly suggested something far more complex—multiple pathways to transcendence, some involving technology while others might embrace limitations as catalysts.

"The probe should include representatives from multiple species," Luna said, her mind organizing requirements. "Not merely technicians but those who understand how different biological frameworks might interact with the anomaly. Perhaps Akari from the Aikawa Den—her work on Kitsune distributed cognition could provide unique insights."

Nexxus considered this, her form shifting between manifestations. "An unusual approach for a military investigation."

"This isn't merely military," Luna responded. "It's an opportunity to understand consciousness through how different frameworks respond to the same phenomenon."

As they concluded the gathering, Luna found herself thinking about Kazumi's point about constraint and meaning. The anomaly seemed to represent consciousness transformation through principles they didn't yet understand—perhaps similar to how the Kitsunes had transformed biological constraints into innovative collaborative systems.

Her consciousness returned to Praxis Station, the transition feeling like awakening from a dream more real than reality. The meditation gardens she had been designing no longer seemed a mere side project but a microcosm of this larger question about how meaning emerges from constraint and creativity.

## Part Four: Praxis

The project briefing room on Praxis Station had been configured for multispecies participation. Luna arrived to find the team already assembled: twelve specialists from each Pentarchal Species, plus three Commonwealth technicians—the third time in Union history that non-Union personnel had access to classified project development.

At the room's center hung a holographic display of the probe: a sleek vessel forty meters in length, its hull configured with multiple interface systems. The design incorporated Commonwealth "legacy systems" alongside the Union's most advanced sensory equipment—a technological hybrid rather than an optimized instrument.

"Welcome," Luna transmitted. "Your presence represents an unprecedented collaboration between different technological paradigms."

Zorath, a silver-scaled Wyrmfolk engineer, gestured at the display. "The probe's hybrid design creates significant integration challenges. The Commonwealth's 21st-century computing operates on fundamentally different principles than our quantum systems."

Akari, the Kitsune researcher, nodded. "The challenge isn't merely technical but conceptual. Commonwealth systems process information sequentially rather than through parallel quantum processing."

Dr. Maya Sorenson, one of the Commonwealth technicians, spoke with an Earth-derived accent. "We understand that our systems seem archaic from your perspective. But they represent a different cognitive framework—not merely limited technology but a distinctive way of engaging with information itself."

Luna studied the probe design, allowing her consciousness to flow through specifications. The Commonwealth systems weren't simply grafted onto Union technology but integrated in ways that created feedback loops between different paradigms. What appeared as inefficient redundancy actually represented deliberate observation from multiple perspectives simultaneously.

"The anomaly seems to interact differently with various technological frameworks," Luna observed. "The Astral Seeker's destruction followed patterns suggesting the vessel's systems contributed to its transformation. The probe's hybrid design isn't a compromise but a strategy—allowing observation of how different interfaces interact with the anomaly's effects."

Zorath's scales shimmered with thought. "You're suggesting that Union quantum systems might respond differently than Commonwealth legacy technology."

"Precisely," Luna confirmed. "And Akari's Kitsune distributed cognition models could provide a third perspective—one that doesn't rely on technological interfaces at all but on collaborative consciousness."

Akari's six tails swished affirmatively. "Kitsune neurology processes information through patterns resembling quantum entanglement without requiring technological enhancement. The probe could record how our distributed cognition interfaces with the anomaly."

The room grew quiet as implications settled. This wasn't merely a technical investigation but a philosophical experiment—observing how consciousness itself responded through different interfaces and frameworks.

"The integration challenges are significant," Zorath acknowledged. "But the data potential justifies the complexity. We'll need distinct communication protocols for each system while ensuring they can share observations without cross-interference."

Dr. Sorenson leaned forward, thoughtful. "Our sequential processing systems might serve as a control group, providing baseline measurements against which the more advanced systems can be compared."

"And our distributed cognition could offer insights into how non-technological interfaces respond," Akari added. "The probe's sensors could record how our collaborative consciousness interacts with the anomaly's effects."

As the team discussed technical challenges, Luna watched them become more confident, shifting from theoretical concerns to practical implementation. The holographic display evolved to show detailed schematics of interior spaces.

"The biological interface chamber will need to accommodate multiple species simultaneously," Zorath observed. "The atmospheric requirements alone create significant engineering challenges."

"The chamber should be interconnected modules rather than a single unified space," Akari suggested. "Each module optimized for specific species while allowing collaborative observation through transparent interfaces."

Dr. Sorenson studied the schematics. "The Commonwealth team could occupy a module configured with Earth-standard atmosphere and gravity. Our biological interfaces would provide additional comparative data."

As the team discussed these possibilities, Luna found herself thinking about the meditation gardens again—how constraints weren't obstacles but elements that shaped experience in particular directions. The Commonwealth's technological limitations might function similarly, creating specific kinds of engagement with reality rather than merely lacking advanced capabilities.

"There's something profound happening here," Luna transmitted, her thoughts becoming more philosophical. "The Commonwealth is preserving something the Union has largely lost: the experience of technological limitation as a shaping force in human development. We've become so accustomed to post-scarcity abundance that we forget how constraints can catalyze creativity."

Her thoughts drifted back to Jeremy Ritter—the terrified Melbourne teenager she had once been, navigating constraints by necessity. Those limitations had shaped her in ways the current Luna Darke, with distributed consciousness and immortal body, sometimes struggled to remember.

"Perhaps this is what the Union needs right now," Luna continued. "Not another expansion of technological capability, but a reminder that meaningful experience doesn't require infinite possibility. The Commonwealth may be preserving something essential to what it means to be conscious, to create, to compete within limitations."

Dr. Sorenson nodded slowly. "The Commonwealth deliberately chose to maintain what you consider earlier technology. We understand this choice represents not stagnation but a different kind of advancement—one that preserves qualities of engagement with reality that more sophisticated technologies might filter out."

Zorath's scales shimmered with thought. "The Wyrmfolk have always equated technological sophistication with progress. But what if some aspects of consciousness are better accessed through primitive interfaces?"

The question hung charged with implications extending far beyond the probe's design. Luna realized that her work with AFC Luna's meditation gardens was a microcosm of this broader philosophical question: how to create meaningful experience within constraints, whether technological, biological, or self-imposed.

As the team continued working through technical details, the holographic display evolved to reflect their expanding understanding. The probe's hybrid design wasn't a compromise between paradigms but a deliberate strategy to observe reality through multiple lenses simultaneously.

Luna sighed, feeling the weight of what they were about to embark upon. Her first real test in a very long time. The Union had grown so complacent with its nanotech and abundance that it had forgotten: meaning must be constructed, not passively received.

## Part Five: Vyktory

The blue light of the monitor painted Luna's face as she worked on architectural schematics for AFC Luna's training grounds. The meditation gardens expansion was a passion project—modifications many dismissed as useless aesthetic work. But Luna understood what others missed: systems were ecosystems where psychological variables rippled through mechanical outcomes.

The gardens needed to serve five different species simultaneously. She had spent months studying xeno-botanical texts, consulting with AI architects, even traveling to Origin Hall to observe how sacred spaces accommodated diverse populations. The solution came during a meditation session where her consciousness expanded beyond individual embodiment.

"The problem isn't biological diversity," Luna Darke had realized. "It's trying to create a single space serving multiple purposes. We need a garden that's simultaneously different for each observer."

Her current design incorporated quantum-entangled light refractors that shifted color and frequency based on retinal structure, sonic dampening fields adapting to each species' optimal hearing range, even subtle gravitational variations creating the sensation of one's homeworld's natural pull. It was absurdly complex for an aesthetic component of a game already stretching computational resources.

Luna smiled, thinking how absurd this would have seemed to Jeremy Ritter—that Melbourne teenager who had played ancient football games on Earth, unaware of what lay ahead. In a civilization that had conquered mortality and scarcity, the primary currency had become meaning. And meaning emerged most powerfully from systems balancing structure with agency, rules with creativity, competition with cooperation—principles she had first encountered in game design.

Her comm chimed with a priority message. Three notes reserved for direct communications from Origin Hall. Only six beings in the Itavran Union could access that frequency.

<We have received another petition from the Vyktorian Commonwealth> came the mental transmission. <They're requesting permission to establish a formal competitive gaming league within their technological constraints.>

Luna's mind immediately calculated variables. The Vyktorian Commonwealth was a curious enclave of Earth-descended humans living under deliberately maintained technological ceiling approximating Earth's early 21st century. It was a sanctuary for those who couldn't adapt to the Union's post-scarcity abundance, a living museum maintained through complicated mixture of guilt and duty toward the refugees who founded it.

What fascinated Luna about the Commonwealth wasn't its technological limitations but its psychological ones. They had chosen to remain in managed scarcity, to experience mortality as genuine possibility rather than theoretical concept. They had intentionally limited their lifespan to approximately 120 years—natural human duration—rather than accepting nanotech systems granting effective immortality. They were essentially living as humans from Luna's own era had lived.

<They want to participate in World Games Association tournaments despite their technological constraints> Luna responded. <They've requested formal recognition as a regional circuit within the WGA framework.>

<The request itself isn't problematic> came Sythini's response, patient and measured. <The difficulty lies in how to integrate a technological subsociety into a post-scarcity competitive framework without undermining the Commonwealth's deliberate limitations or compromising the WGA's meritocratic systems.>

Luna understood what Sythini meant. The Vyktorian Commonwealth represented a fundamental challenge to the Union's core values: that progress was inherently beneficial, that technological advancement was synonymous with advancement, that liberation came through expansion rather than limitation. The Commonwealth had deliberately opted out of that trajectory.

<What does Kazumi think?> Luna asked, shifting her awareness to include her partner's perspective.

<The Den Queen finds the case compellingly different> Sythini responded. <She notes that the Kitsunes didn't choose their reproductive engineering or atmospheric conditions. The Vyktorians have chosen their limitations deliberately, as an act of cultural preservation rather than external imposition. Kazumi suggests this choice deserves respect as an exercise of agency.>

Luna smiled. That was Kazumi—seeing nuance where others saw contradiction, defending choices she wouldn't make for herself on principle alone.

<What if we approach this not as a problem of integration but as a feature of the system itself?> Luna proposed. <Rather than creating exceptions for the Vyktorians, we establish a new category: constrained competition. Formal recognition that the purity of play can be expressed through different technological parameters.>

She expanded on the idea, thoughts flowing in rapid conceptual bursts.

<We already have separate rankings for neural-interface play versus traditional input methods. We track skill ratings differently across species with unique physiological advantages. We maintain distinct leaderboards for solo versus team dynamics. Adding a 'constrained technology' classification wouldn't be creating an exception but acknowledging an existing dimension of competitive experience.>

<There's elegance to this approach> Sythini acknowledged after considered reflection. <It treats the Commonwealth's technological limitations not as deficits to be compensated for but as a distinct competitive ecosystem with its own challenges and virtues.>

Luna nodded to herself, pulling up the garden schematics again. She made a quick adjustment to light refractor specifications, fine-tuning response to unique Felidfolk retinal structures.

<The key would be ensuring the constrained technology classification doesn't become a means of segregation> Luna continued. <Vyktorians should still have pathways to compete in open tournaments if they choose. The system should facilitate movement between categories rather than creating permanent divisions.>

<That would require careful calibration of conversion algorithms> Sythini observed. <Skill acquired under constrained conditions might not translate directly to open competition, yet Vyktorians shouldn't be penalized for self-imposed limitations.>

<The Gaming Collective has developed cross-platform skill mapping> Luna offered. <We've been working on systems identifying transferable competencies across different technological interfaces and input methods. The mathematics is complex but fundamentally sound.>

She paused her work on the gardens, struck by a parallel that hadn't occurred to her before.

<There's something profound happening here> Luna transmitted, thoughts becoming philosophical. <The Commonwealth is preserving something most of the Union has lost: the experience of technological limitation as a shaping force. We've become so accustomed to post-scarcity abundance that we forget how constraints can catalyze creativity.>

Her thoughts drifted back to being Jeremy Ritter on Earth—navigating constraints by necessity, not choice. Those limitations had shaped her in ways the current Luna Darke sometimes struggled to remember.

<Perhaps this is what the Union needs right now> Luna continued. <Not another expansion of technological capability, but a reminder that meaningful experience doesn't require infinite possibility. The Commonwealth may be preserving something essential to being conscious, to creating, to competing within limitations.>

<There is wisdom in this perspective> Sythini finally acknowledged. <The Union has prided itself on diversity, yet we sometimes forget that true diversity includes diversity of approaches to progress itself.>

Luna ended the transmission, returning full attention to her gardens. As she worked, she thought about constraints—not merely as limitations to be overcome but as frameworks shaping creative expression. Like ancient Earth's sonnet form, haiku structure, or pentatonic scales—constraints catalyzed rather than stifled innovation.

She expanded the garden design, adding interconnected micro-environments responding differently to each species' biological needs. For Wyrmfolk: elevated platforms with radiant heating mimicking native deserts. For Ælffolk: ancient trees echoing slow biological cycles. For Vulpfolk: waterfalls creating negative ions enhancing sensory acuity. For Wülffolk and Felidfolk: underground meditation chambers reproducing ancestral cave networks.

The design became meditation on the Union's founding principle: diversity required not merely tolerance but active accommodation. The gardens wouldn't be a single space serving everyone imperfectly, but multiple overlapping environments collectively providing for each species' needs while maintaining aesthetic coherence.

Hours passed in this work, consciousness flowing between schematics, philosophy, and practical player performance metrics. The nanotech drones maintained optimal cognitive functioning, preventing fatigue that might once have forced breaks. Yet Luna chose to step away anyway—not from biological necessity but because the work itself required periodic distance for proper perspective.

She saved the current garden iteration and closed Football Club Creator, then accessed her personal schedule. Next was an appointment anticipated for weeks: meeting with Kazumi at the Aikawa Den on Kunatairō. Even after decades of partnership, these encounters carried particular excitement—a sense of possibility transcending routine duties.

As evening fell on Praxis Station, Luna looked out at the spaceport below. The geometric patterns of arriving and departing ships reflected the Union's essential character. Ships came and went in choreographed dance. The Itavran Union turned its slow rotations around five settled worlds, 8.2 billion people living in civilization of abundance where the primary constraint was no longer survival but meaning.

Games—whether video games, sports, board games, or competitions of any kind—had become the primary mechanism through which that meaning was created and shared. In a world where suffering had been eliminated and death had become nearly impossible, the structured challenge of play was what made existence matter.

Luna closed her eyes and prepared for the quantum transition that would take her consciousness to Kunatairō, to Kazumi, to the next conversation about how constraints could catalyze not just meaning but the most profound experiences consciousness could generate.

The gardens could wait until morning. For now, there were other kinds of beauty to cultivate.

**End of Infinite Future**
