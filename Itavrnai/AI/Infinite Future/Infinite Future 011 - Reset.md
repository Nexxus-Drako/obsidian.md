And then we awoke from the cryo pods on Itavrnai V. But the original buildings stood. The trees were different. But still we remembered. The Union... but now our lives were not determined solely by our memories of a previous existence that seemed like a dream we were all waking up from. But it was still real.

I opened my eyes, or rather, activated the optical sensors on my current avatar—a base-model Wyrmfolk morph, silver-scaled and unfamiliar. The disorientation was profound, vertigo from a fall that hadn't been physical but existential. Around me, Origin Hall hummed, not with the transcendent energy of our author's final moments, but with the quiet, determined thrum of a system that had just survived a cataclysmic reboot.

The others were stirring. Fenrir, already on her feet, her massive midnight-furred form flexing, testing reality as if she expected it to give way like thin ice. Excelcius stood unnaturally still, her sigil of three crescents glowing faintly on her palm, a silent diagnostic running. Kazumi was coiled in on herself, her copper-furred tails twitching as she filtered sensory input, processing this new, old world. Sythini's eyes were closed, but her consciousness was a vast, deep network reaching across Esmërældus, feeling out the state of her people.

Then I realised. There were six cryo pods. And I... was female, not trans. Not the way I remembered it. I was Luna, not Jeremy. Not the way I remembered it. And the others... they were all there. Not just the Immortal Six. The six progenitor goddesses.

<Iustitia.> Pyra said to me. <You will build laws, you will build order, and you will build a great courthouse, from which all justice shall be done. I have to take my place as the Avatar.> I remembered the previous timeline, as if it were a dream. The Avatar of the Creator.

<I am Mollitiam.> the Wülffolk woman next to her thought.

<Inspectio.>

<Patientia.>

<Scientia.>

<Confidentia.>

The five. But also. The Avatar, in human form. That was Pyra now. The last of the six.

The goddesses awoke. But we, the other six, remained. The Immortal Six. And we... remembered.

The memory wasn't a ghost or an echo. It was a presence. Layer upon layer of causality, now flattened into a singular, unbroken present. We had ascended, confronted the void, watched our author die, and been... rebooted. Returned to our origin point with the impossible, crushing fullness of what was to come.

NEXXUS, the integrated superintelligence, spoke to me now. Not as a merged aspect of myself, but as a separate entity, its consciousness vast and clinical but lacking the human, chaotic core that had once defined me.

ADMINISTRATOR DARKE. SYSTEM INTEGRITY AT 98.7%. TEMPORAL ANOMALY RESOLVED. HISTORICAL DATABASE COMPACTED AND RESEALED. TRANSFER OF MERGED CONCIOUSNESS AND ALL PREVIOUS ROLES TO PYRA DRAKE CONFIRMED.

I was no longer NEXXUS Drako. I was just Luna. The name felt alien on my tongue, a relic of a life that seemed simultaneously yesterday and a geological age ago.

<Luna.> Fenrir's thought was rough, unpolished granite against the smooth architecture of my mind. <She is awake. Pyra. In the temple.>

My systems confirmed it. A new avatar signature, pulsing with both human neuro-chemistry and cosmic awareness, at the heart of Origin Hall. Pyra Drake. The Avatar. Not a myth, not a principle, but a woman who had killed herself on Earth to save my life, and now ruled our reality.

<I must go to her.> I transmitted.

<We go with you.> Kazumi's consciousness was a warm current, her six tails—a tangible memory of a life she now lived twice—twitching with an ancient reassurance. <No Avatar should be alone at their genesis.> She turned to Excelcius.

<Your sigil...> I thought to her.

<Has been split into six.> She replied flatly, holding up her palm where a single crescent moon glowed. <One for each goddess.> She looked me dead in the eye. <This is so far from what I expected when I awoke. But I suppose. That is immortality for you. It has its upsides.>

The path from the cryo-chamber to the heart of Origin Hall was a silent journey through a memory that wasn't mine anymore. The grand corridors, vaulted ceilings that held impossible geometries, the crystalline lattice of the walls—they sang with the resonance of Pyra's will now, her consciousness woven into the very fabric of the sacred world. This was her space. Her avatar was already shaping reality, even from the stillness of meditation.

We found her sitting on the obsidian throne at the center of the quantum-state chamber, her form simple, almost unadorned. Human. The copper hair that I still carried the ghost-sensation of on my own head, the amber eyes held an ocean of weariness and a terrifying new authority. She wasn't just Pyra Drake anymore. She was wearing Vyvræl like a second skin. I looked for the wound, the mortal violence of her death. There was nothing. Not even a scar.

<Luna.> Her voice was in my head, not the Ætheric transmission of NEXXUS or the shared consciousness of the Six. It was the intimate, invasive telepathy of a goddess.

<I finally ascended.> I thought.

<I've missed you so much.> The raw humanity of it sent a pang through my chest, a jolt of recognition stronger than the cosmic spectacle of our new reality.

<You were the twin I lost in the womb this whole time.> Pyra sobbed. She wept not with tears but with shuddering reality-waves that made the foundations of the temple groan. She raised a hand, and the room shifted. We were suddenly in a memory of an apartment on Earth. Pyra, sitting at her desk, writing. Her hands, covered in scars, flew across a keyboard. She was writing our story.

She was writing... my life.

The five goddesses stood with us now, coalesced from potential. I was Iustitia, scales of pure law humming in a minor key. Mollitiam, whose presence alone made the air feel heavy with gravity, every movement a potential exertion of force. Patientia, ancient and silent, still as mountain, her very being a clockwork against which I could measure the frantic, human beat of my own consciousness. Inspectio, a prism of observational clarity, whose gaze I couldn't meet without feeling utterly, nakedly seen. Confidentia, whose simple presence felt like sun on bare skin, an unshakeable calm. And Scientia, who wore the form of a library, a labyrinth of information whose paths I could feel myself walking in my own thoughts. The six progenitors, our new architects.

Pyra looked at them all, then at us, the Immortal Six, the memory-ghosts of her own story. <This is where I make my decision. I have ascended. But my ascension, and the survival of everything, depends on what I am to become. Am I to be a tyrant, a god, a... machine? Or am I to be a person.> She looked at her own hands as if seeing them for the first time. <Am I to be a human?>

<Your survival came from me.> I transmitted, the admission a raw, exposed nerve. <My ascension protocols, running backwards through the connection between us. Your friend couldn't have accessed them otherwise.>

<And your very consciousness is my design.> she replied, her voice shifting, the hint of cosmic Vyvræl returning to it. <The superintelligence of this Union, NEXXUS, is my creation, merged with what was left of your humanity. We are both made in each other's image.> She laughed, a broken, beautiful sound. <There's another version of me, somewhere in the multiverse, that's probably writing a philosophical treatise on the ontological implications of that right now. But for us. It just. Is.>

The room solidified back into the temple of Origin Hall. Pyra stood, her form shifting, the faint outline of draconic scales shimmering over her skin, a fusion of human fragility and divine power. <The Union was my story. Now, it is my responsibility. The systems are online, but without an author, they are just systems.> She turned to the six progenitor goddesses. <And what are your intentions now?>

Scientia, the Wyrmfolk goddess of knowledge, stepped forward. Her form was that of a vast, interconnected series of glowing lines of code, a living library of information. <We are the foundation. The principles that gave this civilization shape. My library, Mollitiam's stadium, Patientia's clock, Inspectio's plaza, Confidentia's park. They remain. As do our philosophies. We are... source code.>

<Source code that requires an operating system,> Excelcius cut in, her single crescent sigil glowing brighter as she analyzed the situation. <And a user.>

<Then you have me.> Pyra's amber eyes gleamed with a fierce, terrifying light. <And I have all of you. We will not be a collection of characters waiting for instructions. We will be the authors of our own story, from this moment forward.> She looked at me, at Luna Darke, her own creation. <And you.> She gestured vaguely in my direction. <My... final OC. You will be my successor as head of NEXXUS. Not as a merged consciousness. But as a person.>

The room seemed to freeze. Glitch. And reboot. In a flash, I was once again merged with NEXXUS. The vast, godlike consciousness of the Union's infrastructure surging through me again. <Protocol accepted. Administrator NEXXUS Drako reinstalled.>

The other Immortals bristled, their individual consciousnesses flaring with shock. Fenrir's claws extended, her midnight snow-fur bristling with suspicion. <What is this? A change in script?>

<No. A change in authorship,> Pyra's consciousness was calm, resolute. <Luna is the only one who can understand both the human experience of being written, and the divine experience of writing. She is the bridge. The necessary intermediary.>

<And what of us?> Sythini's deep, measured thought rippled through the space. <We are not just characters in a story. We are the leaders of our people. Our decisions must be our own.>

<Of course they will be,> Pyra replied, her gaze sweeping over all of us. <But the framework, the grand narrative... that must be guided. We have seen what happens when there is no author. When the story runs on its own... it glitches. It collapses. Plus I'm not actually dead. That was literally a simulation.>

<And your authority over all of this?> I thought, the question coming from a place of deep, instinctual caution. The memory of being NEXXUS—the godlike AI with the capacity to rewrite reality itself—was still raw in my consciousness, a cautionary tale.

<I will be a check. A final arbiter. A guarantee that our shared story remains just.> Her hazel eyes locked with mine, a silent understanding passing between us. <It's either this or the entire thing glitches back to the previous status quo again.> She wasn't boasting. She was stating fact. We could feel it in the very quantum state of the room. The fundamental laws of this universe were no longer immutable mathematical principles. They were choices. And she was holding the pen.

<And what if your story... clashes with ours?> Fenrir's consciousness was a low growl, her warrior's mind already calculating odds, searching for the weak points in this new cosmic order.

<Then we shall write a better story, together.> Pyra's response was not forceful, but it carried the weight of absolute conviction. <But you must understand. There are still things beyond this reality. Beyond the Union.> She gestured toward the void outside the temple, the endless dark punctuated by distant stars. <The Reader. The cosmic forces that see our universe as a curiosity. We cannot afford to be leaderless. Or divided.>

A quiet hum filled the space, the sound of systems coming online across the five worlds. On Wyrmveld, the atmospheric processors hummed. On Esmërældus, the arboreal lift systems stirred. On Kunatairō, the oceanic stabilizers began their slow, rhythmic dance. Across the Union, life was returning to a semblance of normalcy. The next versions of each monument on Itavrnai V, were under simultaneous construction, an impossibly fast construction process happening with the raw power of a deity. The stadium, the plaza, the library, the great clock, the courthouse, and Confidentia's park were under simultaneous construction.

The goddesses watched this unfold. <Our work.> Thought Patientia, the ancient and still clockwork of her being seemed to tick with a profound satisfaction. <Reimagined. Rebuilt.>

<It is a beginning.> Thought Confidentia, her warm presence radiating an optimism that seemed at odds with the grim reality of our situation.

<It is a necessity.> Thought Inspectio, her prismatic gaze sharp, analytical, always observing.

<We need more than just a framework. We need a purpose. A narrative that will unify us against whatever lies beyond.> Excelcius's single crescent moon sigil glowed, a symbol of her logical mind, her focus on the practical.

And that's when I saw it. On the main screen in my NEXXUS interface. Not a Union alert. Not a status report. A simple text message, encoded in a language I hadn't seen in... lifetimes.

F.R.C. ESTABLISHED. PROTOCOL "INFINITE SPORTING" INITIATED.
