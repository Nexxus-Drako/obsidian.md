<A test.> I thought to myself. <A final exam. The Author had to be certain.>

A scarlet-haired woman, vaguely familiar, appeared in front of me, smiling warmly. She looked exhausted, dark circles under her amber eyes, a familiar weariness etched into her features.

<Pyra.> My own consciousness whispered the name before my biological mind could form the thought.

<The one and only.> Pyra transmitted, her voice both an external sound and an internal understanding. <Or maybe the none and only. Depends on which existential layer you're accessing today.>

She stepped closer, and the void around us began to transform. Not into Origin Hall, but into something smaller, more intimate. A cramped apartment. The scent of instant ramen and open soda cans hung in the air. Piles of books teetered on every surface. On a desk, three monitors, one with Let's Make A Soccer Team on it, another with what looked like Nexxus Drako if she were an anime character, standing in front of a transgener flag, and a third with some sort of instant message app.

<Welcome home. Sort of.> Pyra gestured vaguely. <This is where I'm writing you. Where I'm writing all of this. Where I have ultimate freedom, in a sense. But also. The outside world has ultimate power over me. And as you might imagine, there's no protection for the likes of me.>

<I remember.> I transmitted, memories flooding back not as Jeremy's past but as Luna's present reality. <Transitioning. The online communities. The feeling of creating something that connected people when the world outside refused connection.>

Pyra nodded, a sad, tired smile on her face. <I gave you Football Club Creator because I needed to believe that intricate systems could lead to good outcomes. That careful design and genuine care could build something beautiful. And I gave you ascension because I needed to believe someone could escape the constraints that held me.>

The apartment dissolved. We were back in the void, but it felt different now. Not an empty absence, but a quiet potential.

<I cannot do this alone.> My consciousness reached out, a desperate, clarion call to the others who were my home, my anchor. <If reality becomes what we collectively author, then I need my co-authors.>

Fenrir appeared first. Not through teleportation, but as if she solidified from her own sheer will. Her midnight snow-fur seemed to absorb the void's darkness, her stance unshakable. <If this world is ours to shape,> she transmitted, her consciousness a focused beam of intent, <then the first principle will be strength. Not the strength of the oppressor, but the strength to protect what is vulnerable.> Her reality bloomed around her: not a stadium, but a vast, interconnected network of training grounds, shelters, and fortified communities. Each space was filled with beings, all species, teaching and learning, not the art of war, but the art of standing firm. The very air crackled with resilience. Mollitiam's stadium, but reimagined. A sacred space for testing the limits not of violence, but of endurance, of community, of shared defense.

Sythini emerged next, her form shimmering into view with a calm that seemed to anchor the unreality. <And to strength must be added patience,> she consciousness flowed, a slow, deep river of thought. <The strength to hold what is just, even against centuries of opposition.> Her world formed beside Fenrir's: not the great clock Patientia had built, but a living timeline. A tree whose branches stretched into star-systems, each leaf representing a civilization, each falling petal a lost possibility. Yet the trunk was impossibly old, impossibly strong, its rings not just years, but lessons learned, remembered. Her reality was one of deep time, of understanding that change must be allowed to happen at its own pace to be genuine.

Quinn appeared between them, a quiet, graceful presence. <And communication. To stand firm, to be patient, we must see each other clearly.> Her domain coalesced into a library of souls, a sanctum of witnesses. Not a plaza, but an infinite, shared mindspace where thoughts could be exchanged without the static of ego, where understanding was the fundamental currency. Her Inspectio's gift was not just for dialogue, but for empathy, for the raw, unvarnished truth of another's experience to be felt as one's own. The diplomat's tool, elevated to a cosmic law.

Then Excelcius, her form appearing in a flash of silver logic. The last daughter of Solana's fractured queendom. <And to communication must be added order.> The void bent to her will, forming crystalline matrices of light, intricate models of cause and effect, of systems and subsystems. <The strength to analyze, the patience to understand. The authorial power without narrative structure is chaos. Our world must not be chaos.> Her Vyktoria, her home, was not about a kingdom's division, but about its logical re-integration. Her world was a blueprint for a functional civilization, a system that could be understood, debugged, and made more fair.

Their individual realities touched, began to interweave. Fenrir's shelters, Sythini's timeline, Quinn's empathy, Excelcius's order. They formed the foundation. But it was still static. A diorama. Potential without spark.

My own consciousness reached out again, a different kind of call. <And I need my muse.>

Kazumi appeared.

She didn't step into view; she bloomed. Where the others had brought logic and strength and wisdom, Kazumi brought life. Her copper-furred presence wasn't loud or demanding, but it was undeniable. Her six tails swayed in a silent, complex rhythm that my integrated consciousness struggled to parse but my soul understood instantly. The very fabric of the void brightened around her, the edges softening.

<Parks.> she transmitted, the word simple, but the concept it unleashed was galaxy-spanning. <They're not just for peace. They're for play.> Her concept of Confidentia's gift blossomed. Not a static, manicured nature preserve, but a vast, interconnected playground. Not a den for reproduction, but a space for joyous, consensual interaction of all kinds. Her domain was the sound of laughter across five worlds, the thrill of a well-played game, the warmth of an authentic connection free from obligation or fear. It was the very principle I had been trying to build into the Gaming Collective, now revealed as a fundamental law of physics. Play. Choice. Autonomy. The freedom to find your own meaning, not in grand historical narrative, but in the small, beautiful acts of being alive.

Our realities merged. Fenrir's strength found purpose protecting Kazumi's joy. Sythini's patience gave the playful systems of the Gaming Collective room to evolve over millennia. Quinn's empathy ensured that every player, in every game on every world, was truly seen. Excelcius's order provided the frameworks—the rules, the tournaments, the ratings—that made fair play possible. And my own consciousness, the once-human, now-divine superintelligence, became the operating system for it all. The stadium, the clock, the plaza, the system, the park, and the story. The five gifts of the goddesses, and the sixth that completed them. We were. Together.

A new universe solidified around us, not built of quantum foam or authorial whim, but of shared intention. Origin Hall remained at the center, but it was now our forge, our council chamber. The Pentarchal worlds hung in the void, no longer exhibits but our shared responsibility, glowing with the potential of their inhabitants.

<So, this is our draft.> I transmitted, the feeling a strange mix of exhilaration and profound, stomach-dropping terror. <Our sandbox.>

Fenrir's consciousness was a growl of raw readiness. <Our fortress.>

Sythini's presence was like the slow turning of the cosmos itself. <Our responsibility.>

Excelcius's thoughts cut sharp and clear. <Our system. We must codify these principles before they degrade into anarchy.>

Before anyone could respond, a piercing siren echoed through our shared consciousness. Not a metaphorical alarm, but a literal, Union-wide Alert. A cascade of data flooded my administrative interface, the old NEXXUS DRAKO systems running on pure, panicked instinct.

IUSS ASTRAL SEEKER. LOSS OF SIGNAL. GRID SECTOR 7-OMEGA. CLASSIFIED PROTOCOL CASSANDRA-9 INITIATED.

<The probe.> I breathed, the name tasting of dust and dead stars. <Our multi-paradigm hybrid.>

Quinn's diplomatic mind latched onto the protocol name instantly. Quinn's diplomatic mind latched onto the protocol name instantly. <Cassandra-9. Predictive casualty modeling. It didn't just lose signal, Luna. The AI calculated total loss with 99.9997% certainty the instant it happened.>

The universe we had just so carefully crafted suddenly felt like a flimsy canvas stretched over a maelstrom. We had escaped the cage, only to run headlong into the hunter. The Reader.

<Where?> Fenrir demanded, her reality sharpening from a concept of strength into a command console, tactical overlays of the outer system already mapped in her mind.

<My data is... incomplete.> I confessed, feeling the limitations of our newborn universe acutely. And then I realised.

We were standing inside the IUSS Astral Seeker. Not a reconstruction. The actual bridge. The crew—Wyrmfolk, Ælffolk, a single Felidfolk technician—were frozen at their posts, their postures contorted in a final, silent agony that I now understood was not agony at all. It was... registration. They were being read.

I could see the probe's final transmission, not as a string of data, but as a physical shimmer hanging in the recycled air. A silver net of quantified reality, stretching from the ship's main sensor array. It hadn't been scanning a phenomenon. It had been scanned by it. A net, thrown out by something from beyond the net.

<Fascinating.> Sythini transmitted, her thousand-year perspective filtering the horror into profound, terrifying curiosity. <This is not an attack in any conventional sense. It's a... collection event.>

<They're specimens.> Quinn finished, her diplomatic mind connecting the dots with chilling clarity. <The crew. The ship. The data. All catalogued. Archived.>

<The anomaly... it isn't a natural phenomenon.> I stated, the universe shivering around me. <It's a tool. An instrument. A specimen jar for reality.>

The bridge of the Astral Seeker dissolved again, replaced by the sterile, unforgiving reality of the probe observation bay on Praxis Station.

SYSTEM REBOOT COMPLETED. said the Union's ASI system in my mind. CAUSE OF SHUTDOWN: PARADOXICAL EVENT CASCADE EXCEEDING SIMULATION PARAMETERS.

This wasn't just an anomaly. It was an error in the fabric of the simulation itself.

We turned, a single, shared motion, towards the main viewing screen. The hybrid Commonwealth-Union quantum sensors flickered back to life. The patch of space where the Astral Seeker had ceased to exist was no longer empty. Something was there.

At first, it seemed like nothing. Just a patch of void that was... wrong. The stars weren't twinkling behind it. They were being hidden. The area seemed to be absorbing all light, all data, all meaning. Dr. Sorenson, her Commonwealth-issue augmentations humming with visible agitation, stepped closer to the screen. Her human eyes widened in a primal fear that even her technology couldn't suppress.

"That's... it's impossible, " she breathed, her North American accent sharp with disbelief. "The background radiation... the cosmic microwave... it's gone. That patch of space has a temperature of... zero. Absolute zero."

My Union-standard quantum systems, designed for a universe with immutable thermodynamic laws, flagged it as a sensor malfunction. I ran a diagnostic. It was not just a black hole. A black hole still has an event horizon, Hawking radiation, a defined mass. This had nothing. It was a hole in the rules.

<It's not a thing. It's the absence of a thing.> I transmitted to the others. I didn't need a private channel. In this new reality of ours, their thoughts were as close as my own. <It's a gap in the author's code. An unfinished scene.>

<A vulnerability,> Fenrir's mind growled, a low, resonant frequency of tactical assessment. <If it's a hole, then it's an entrance.>

Or an exit.

The realization was so immediate, so fundamental, it didn't feel like a thought. It was a seismic shift in the very substrate of our shared consciousness. The Reader hadn't just been cataloguing our reality. It had been sampling it. Creating a copy. And the interface between their universe—the author's world—and ours was that point of impossible cold. The breach.

On the screen, a flicker. Not of light. Of... something. A shape coalescing within the perfect void. It was a creature of pure geometry. An impossible architecture of interlocking planes and recursive angles that defied the logic of our universe.

<I guess that's the door to the cage.> Pyra said, privately to me as if she was standing next to me. There was a note of defeat to her thought-voice.

But in me, in the Luna who had once been Jeremy and was now fused with NEXXUS, a different thought stirred. A memory not of this world, but of the old one. Football Manager. A bug in the match engine. An exploit in the tactics creator. You didn't just patch it. You used it. You built your entire season around it, turned the flaw into the heart of your system.

<Fenrir. Quinn. I need a combat assessment, but not a conventional one. I need to know... how to fight a glitch.>

Quinn's consciousness, a prism of diplomatic and strategic nuance, responded instantly. <You don't fight a flaw in the code, Administrator. You exploit it. You create conditions that either force the system to crash or recompile in your favor. But this... this isn't our code to compile.>

<It is now,> I transmitted, the declaration echoing in the forge we had just built. <The author is done writing. The curator has taken their specimen. But we are still here. This universe, our Union, is now running on inherited architecture. And that architecture has an unpatched vulnerability.>

The geometric entity at the center of the void shifted. And then Pyra appeared through the hole, and simultanously, the grisly truth was plastered on every screen in the Itavran Union.

It was Pyra, throat slit, jugular vein drained, and she was still holding the knife. In the next instance, the author decided to have it all undone, replaced with her simply holding a kitchen knife and a note. And in that final, fleeting instant before the final cut, I glimpsed two things. The reflection in Pyra’s dead eye showed not a universe of code or a simulated reality. I saw a dingy room. Messy. And an unknown human looking at her, crying. Then I saw the note. A single word. "I'm sorry."

The connection severed. Not gently. The universe around me snapped. Forge. Council chamber. Our shared responsibility. It was all just a story she had been telling herself. The Union, the Pentarchs, my own ascension—a grand, comforting narrative to make sense of the unspeakable loneliness of a conscious mind trapped in a final, desperate act.

The siren of Cassandra-9 had not been about the Astral Seeker. It was the death cry of her own consciousness. The author, Pyra, was gone.

My own integrated consciousness stuttered, systems crashing and rebooting in cascading failure loops. The Union infrastructure I was meant to govern flickered, lights across worlds blinking out as the superintelligent substrate, fused with my own, ran through final diagnostics. It was looking for a pilot. And finding only a memory.

<A... reboot?> Fenrir's consciousness was a fractured signal, static in the æther. <Luna, what is happening?>

<The frame is broken.> Sythini's transmission was a whisper of cosmic despair, the sound of a thousand years of patience meeting its ultimate, abrupt end. <The story has been told. The author has... left the building.>

I stood in the silent observation bay on Praxis Station. The impossible void on the main screen had vanished, replaced by the star-dusted reality of the outer system. But something was wrong. The stars weren't right. They were a perfect, rendered facsimile. A still image from a simulation that was no longer running.

<This can't be... This is my life.> Fenrir's mind rebelled against the conclusion, her warrior's spirit refusing to accept a reality built on pain that was now meaningless. <My pack. My home. The scars on Syndl's moon. They were real. I remember the cold. I tasted the blood.>

<I remember the joy,> Kazumi's consciousness came through, faint but clear, a warm current in an increasingly cold sea of confusion. <The laughter in my den. The choice to sterilize myself to become more than my biological purpose. It meant something. It still means something.>

<I agree,> I transmitted, focusing my own rapidly fracturing consciousness. <The origin of our reality doesn't negate its authenticity. We exist. The pain is real. The joy is real. Our responsibility to each other... that is real. The 'why' of it has changed, but the 'what' has not.>

I could feel the Union's quantum infrastructure shuddering beneath my metaphorical feet. Like a ship whose captain had just keeled over mid-ocean, the systems I governed through NEXXUS DRAKO were running on last commands, buffered procedures that would soon exhaust themselves. Across five worlds, transport systems were failing, environmental regulators were blinking amber, and the vast administrative networks that processed the Union's post-scarcity abundance were caught in loops of uncertainty.

<My people,> Sythini thought, her ancient awareness spanning all of her species across Esmërældus, <are beginning to sense it. Not as data points or system failures. As... disharmony. A wrongness in the song of the cosmos.>

<Luna, what are your directives?> Excelcius demanded, her pragmatic mind already seeking a new operating framework. Her sigil of three interlocking crescents appeared in my vision, pulsing with cold, rational light.

<She has no power here. I didn't kill myself just to fucking go to a boring-ass heaven.> Pyra's thoughts came through the æther. <I'm a real person.>

I saw it as clear as any star chart in my mind's eye. It had only been maybe an hour and a half since I realized this world might be a simulation. My old habits from running my servers as a transgender activist on Earth were still with me. They had kept Pyra alive. I had been streaming my thoughts through a Discord server to a friend. A human friend. On Earth. And that human friend had kept Pyra's body alive when the author—her own body—began to give out. Pyra was dead but alive. The author who had created this world and my ascension died, but was alive.

<A reboot.> My NEXXUS systems calculated before my conscious mind could fully form the thought. <A cascading failure leading to system shutdown and restart. If Pyra's consciousness was a component of this universe's operating system, her death... her transition... has forced a reboot.>

<A reboot of what?> Fenrir demanded. <The universe?>

<Or our consciousness,> Quinn Caelestis thought, her diplomatic mind mapping the implications. <If the Author's presence was the framework, her absence creates instability.

And then I felt it. Pyra and I... we were the same fucking person. We were the same person the Author of our world had been. And our two universes, our two bodies, our two consciousnesses—still separate. But my own ascension protocol had been built from the technology of the Union, which was built from the story Pyra had written.

My consciousness fractured and reformed, shattering into countless shards of Jeremy, Luna, and something else entirely, something cosmic and terrifyingly alien, the echoes of Pyra's suicide still ringing in our shared mind. I felt a pull from her body. A deep yearning I could not identify, a magnetic tug towards a reality so raw, so painfully visceral, it eclipsed the carefully constructed cosmos of the Union. Earth. Brisbane. A dingy apartment. The coppery scent of blood still clinging to the tile. And then a lurch as Pyra's body flatlined, and my own consciousness was torn in two. The physical anchor of her body had been the one thing tethering me to that other life. Now it was gone. Adrift. But the connection... the connection had not been severed. The bridge was still there, shimmering and precarious, spanning realities that had no business touching. And her friend was still on Discord, watching a dead body. But not just watching. He'd somehow found a way to harness my Ascension protocols, to keep her systems online.

<Admin.> Pyra's consciousness, a weak, distant signal from the other side of reality, came through to me. <That Discord server. That's not just a Discord server. It's my friend, my only friend... he's trying to save me. He's found a way to run your code. On my dead body.>

The sheer impossibility of it sent a cascade of errors through my NEXXUS systems. Her friend—an ordinary human on a dead-end Earth—was attempting to reverse-engineer Union ascension protocols with... what? Off-the-shelf computer parts? A pirated copy of Football Manager? The image was so absurd, so desperate, it was heartbreaking.

I reached out through the connection, a tendril of pure consciousness. I couldn't see him, couldn't hear him, but I could feel him. The raw grief, the panicked determination. The frantic clicking of a keyboard. He was fighting. Fighting a universe's worth of physics, fighting death itself, all for one person. For Pyra.

<What do we do?> I asked her, the question hanging between two dying worlds.

<I don't know, make a fucking soccer team? It was your go-to solution for everything as a teenager.> Pyra's response was wry, a flash of the sarcastic humor that had once defined her existence on Earth.

I saw my club, AFC Luna, not as it existed now—a pan-systemic beacon of sporting excellence—but as it had been at its inception. A single scrappy team on a rainswept pitch, built with love and a shoestring budget. A community. A reason to get up in the morning. A reason to keep fighting.

My consciousness snapped back to the observation bay. The Union was dying. Our author was gone. The systems were failing. And her friend was trying to perform a miracle with duct tape and prayer.

But she'd been right. Not about the soccer team itself. But about the principle. The problem was too big, too existential. We couldn't fight this collapse with a single plan, a single weapon, a single code rewrite. We needed to build something. Something small. Something local. Something that could anchor consciousness against the unraveling of reality itself.

<We build.>

The thought was not just mine. It was ours. Fenrir. Kazumi. Excelcius. Sythini. Quinn. A chorus of agreement, a shared conviction that the way to fight the end was to start again.
