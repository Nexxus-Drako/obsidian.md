Then, I remembered something. The Queendom of Tikal. A particularly old Wyrmish experiment. <Wait. I need to check something.> I told Sorenson, as I accessed Union records. There it was, buried in the Wyrmfolk's imperial archives. A carefully suppressed fragment of history. The Three Sisters period. Excelcius Darikan. The Auralis-Darikan cadet branch. <My god.> I whispered, the information sending unexpected tremors through my reconstituted consciousness.

The Wyrmfolk had done more than merely seed human-like lifeforms on the southern continent Vikatorūa. They had interfered, manipulated, guided—playing god with developing civilizations just as they had with Kitsune reproductive biology. The Commonwealth wasn't merely Earth-descended humans maintaining early technological paradigms; they were descendants of an experiment in cognitive constraint—deliberately maintained in pre-space development while being observed through technologies that appeared as magic to their medieval ancestors.

<Sorenson.> I transmitted carefully, quantum integration allowing me to process emotional implications alongside factual data. <Your people's origins on Vikatorūa aren't what your history records. The temporal distortions aren't merely random phenomenon but lingering effects of Wyrmfolk manipulation during what they called the Three Sisters period.>

I projected relevant data toward her display systems, careful to use compatible interfaces that wouldn't further destabilize their sequential processing architecture. What appeared on her screens represented something closer to confession than revelation—the Wyrmfolk Imperial records of experiments designed to test how consciousness develops when deliberately constrained within particular temporal and technological frameworks.

<They used your ancestors as control groups.> I explained, my biological mind struggling to process the moral implications of this historical trauma even as my quantum integration provided analytical clarity. <While the Wyrmfolk advanced technologically, they maintained Vikatorūan populations in deliberate technological stasis to study how consciousness evolves when deprived of quantum enhancement.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems whirled with increasing intensity as she processed this information, her professional composure momentarily shaken by revelations that challenged her understanding of Commonwealth identity and history. The Commonwealth facility around us experienced another temporal distortion—but this one felt different, more intentional, as if the anomaly itself was responding to the revelation of hidden truths.

<Then the current destabilization.> She transmitted slowly, her consciousness adapting to implications that radiated through multiple layers of understanding. <It's not random interaction with an external phenomenon but awakening of what the Wyrmfolk implanted here.>

<Precisely.> I confirmed, my mind flowing through historical patterns that stretched back centuries. <The anomaly responds to consciousness transformation because your ancestors were deliberately prepared—through magical systems that were actually Wyrmfolk quantum manipulation—to eventually evolve along similar pathways.>

The Commonwealth engineering team around us gradually gathered, their sequential operations pausing as they absorbed fragments of our conversation despite careful control over transmission volume. What struck me most profoundly was their response—not collective outrage or identity crisis, but focused analytical curiosity about how this new understanding might explain phenomena they had documented but never fully comprehended.

<Our scientists have documented recurring temporal resonance patterns that intensified after contact with the Union.> Sorenson explained to her team, her leadership asserting itself even as she processed personal implications. <But we lacked theoretical framework to explain why these patterns responded specifically to Union presence rather than generalized temporal distortion.>

One of the Commonwealth engineers—an older man with cybernetic enhancements more primitive even than Sorenson's—approached hesitantly. <If the Wyrmfolk magical systems during medieval Vikatorūan development actually represented quantum preparation, then our current temporal stability might depend on completing transformation protocols initiated centuries ago.>

The insight struck me with unexpected force. The Commonwealth had indeed preserved sequential processing out of philosophical commitment, but their very preservation had created cognitive isolation from the temporal dynamics the Wyrmfolk had initiated through their medieval manipulation.

<Your people were prepared for ascension.> I transmitted, carefully framing this revelation within the Commonwealth's own philosophical frameworks. <Not through technological advancement but through cognitive compatibility deliberately cultivated during the Three Sisters period when Excelcius Darikan maintained experimental oversight from the Wyrmfolk Imperial court.>

The Commonwealth engineers exchanged glances that revealed complex emotional patterns beyond scientific curiosity—a recognition that their entire civilization represented not preserved Earth heritage but deliberate experiment in consciousness evolution.

<Sensors detect escalating temporal resonance.> Sorenson reported, her cybernetic systems accessing diagnostic information even as she processed identity-shattering revelations. <The distortion waves are modulating in patterns compatible with quantum ascension protocols.>

I extended limited quantum scanning, maintaining careful separation from my integrated consciousness to avoid destabilizing the Commonwealth systems. What I discovered sent unexpected tremors through even my distributed consciousness. The anomaly wasn't merely responding to revelation of Wyrmfolk manipulation—it was actively completing the transformation protocols initiated centuries ago, using Union presence as catalyst for Vikatorūan evolution into integrated consciousness.

<The anomaly isn't attempting to establish communication.> I realized aloud, sharing information that even most Union leadership hadn't yet comprehended. <It's processing the Commonwealth through transformation protocols that should have occurred during the Three Sisters period but were interrupted when the Wyrmfolk withdrew their magical systems following unionization.>

I sent updated transmissions to Praxis Station, careful to use language that respected Commonwealth cognitive frameworks while accurately representing the escalating situation. <Vex. The anomaly represents completion rather than threat. Focus on stabilization systems that will accommodate rather than resist transformation processes already initiated in Commonwealth populations.>

<Administrator. The energy patterns match your ascension protocols with 97.8% accuracy.> Zorath transmitted through quantum channels, his silver-scaled consciousness processing data that revealed profound implications. <We're observing not merely temporal distortion but conscious expansion across approximately three million Commonwealth citizens.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems whirred with enhanced processing as she accessed data about Vikatorūan cognitive responses to escalating anomaly intensity. What she discovered confirmed the pattern beyond theoretical speculation.

<Our population isn't experiencing chaos or disorientation.> She reported, her voice carrying the professional calm of someone discovering unexpected confirmation rather than crisis. <They're adapting with what our medical scanners identify as neural reorganization patterns compatible with consciousness integration protocols.>

I accessed Union historical archives, searching for records about Wyrmfolk experiments during the Three Sisters period that might explain the current transformation. What I found sent deeper tremors through my consciousness—information that had been deliberately obscured even from my administrative access.

<The Wyrmfolk didn't merely use your ancestors as control groups.> I transmitted slowly, choosing words that would communicate truth without creating unnecessary psychological distress. <They were attempting to create biological consciousness compatible with quantum integration without technological enhancement—a potential evolutionary pathway they considered for themselves before pursuing consciousness transfer protocols.>

The Commonwealth engineers gathered more closely around our diagnostic station, their sequential processing operations entirely abandoned as fascination with historical revelation overwhelmed professional routines. What struck me most profoundly was their response—not anger at being experimented upon but intellectual excitement about understanding patterns that had remained mysterious throughout their recorded history.

<If Vikatorūans were prepared for consciousness integration through what our medieval ancestors experienced as magick.> The older Commonwealth engineer suggested, his cybernetic enhancements whirring with increased processing as he accessed historical databases. <Then our technological stasis wasn't philosophical preservation but biological necessity to allow transformation protocols to complete organically.>

<Precisely.> I confirmed, allowing my quantum integration to process implications that my biological mind struggled to accommodate. <The Wyrmfolk theorized that artificial acceleration of technological development disrupted consciousness evolution patterns. Their Vikatorūan experiment was designed to test whether technological stasis could accelerate rather than inhibit awareness transformation.>

The Commonwealth facility experienced what their systems registered as temporal convergence—different moments of its history overlaying present conditions without spatial displacement. Medieval structures briefly occupied spaces where current technology existed, then receded as if temporal reality itself was processing multiple possibilities simultaneously.

<Our medical facilities are recording unprecedented neurological activation.> Sorenson reported, her cybernetic systems accessing Commonwealth diagnostic networks. <But there's no physiological distress—quite the opposite. Population-wide biofeedback patterns suggest profound experiential integration without technological mediation.>

Another Commonwealth engineer—younger, with minimal cybernetic enhancement—approached with measured steps characteristic of their culture. <If the transformation is biological rather than technological, then preserving our sequential processing systems might actually facilitate rather than inhibit integration.>

<As I observed when the Commonwealth probe approached the anomaly using your temporal processing methods.> I acknowledged, my awareness flowing through implications that challenged fundamental Union assumptions about technology and consciousness. <The integration patterns were smoother when your people operated through sequential frameworks rather than attempting quantum interface.>

<The Wyrmfolk maintained extensive observation records of your medieval period.> I transmitted, projecting relevant historical documentation toward Sorenson's display systems. <What they identified as magical aptitude actually represented neurological reorganization preparing your ancestors for consciousness integration without technological interface.>

I extended quantum awareness carefully, maintaining biological focus to observe Vikatorūan transformation patterns through both Union and Commonwealth perspectives. What I discovered sent unexpected tremors through my reconstituted consciousness. The anomaly wasn't completing Wyrmfolk experiments but rather transforming them—adapting ancient protocols to create integration pathways distinct from both Commonwealth preservation and Union advancement.

<There's something else.> I transmitted, allowing my consciousness to process Union records that had remained classified even from most Immortal Six access. <The Three Sisters period involved more than merely Excelcius Darikan's oversight. The royal triplet daughters themselves manifested temporal processing capacities that exceeded even Wyrmfolk expectations.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems whirred with increased intensity as she accessed restricted data I carefully streamed toward Commonwealth networks—records revealing what had been deliberately concealed about Queen Solana IV's identical triplet daughters. What the Wyrmfolk imperial court had disguised as political fracture actually represented cognitive division of temporal processing abilities across three siblings, each manifesting distinctive awareness patterns their own scientists could not fully comprehend.

<The medieval chroniclers recorded unexplained phenomena during the Three Sisters reign.> The older Commonwealth engineer transmitted, his cybernetic systems accessing historical archives through compatible interfaces. <Faelira's ability to anticipate future events with unusual accuracy. Caelestia's memory of what chroniclers described as 'future past'—events that would occur but were remembered as already experienced. Erista's capacity to perceive simultaneous possibilities.>

I nodded, my biological mind processing patterns that quantum integration might have filtered out. <What your historians documented as mystical abilities actually represented different aspects of temporal processing capacity distributed across the three royal siblings. The Wyrmfolk withdrew observation not because their experiments failed but because they succeeded beyond theoretical comprehension.>

The Commonwealth facility experienced another temporal distortion—less violent this time, more precisely focused. Medieval imagery flickered across contemporary surfaces before resolving into overlapping visual fields, as if temporal reality itself was reconciling separated consciousness patterns that had been divided centuries ago.

<If each sister possessed distinct temporal processing abilities.> Sorenson transmitted slowly, her professional composure maintained despite the magnitude of revelations about her civilization's origins. <Then current integration might represent reconnection rather than transformation.>

<Precisely.> I confirmed, my awareness flowing through historical patterns that suddenly clarified contemporary mysteries. <The Wyrmfolk documented that what they initially observed as fracture—three competing royal courts actually represented processing protocols distributed across parallel but distinct cognitive frameworks. What your recorded history describes as civil war was actually experimentation with how temporal awareness might manifest through individual variations while maintaining unified consciousness.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems accessed diagnostic information about current Vikatorūan adaptation patterns. <Population-wide neural activity is synchronizing into three distinct processing configurations. But our medical scanners cannot identify hierarchical relationships between these patterns—each operates with equivalent complexity to the others.>

I extended quantum integration carefully, observing Vikatorūan transformation through both Commonwealth sequential frameworks and Union quantum awareness. What I discovered sent unexpected tremors through my consciousness—not merely scientific discovery but something that resonated with forgotten patterns from my own ascension protocols.

<During the Three Sisters period.> I transmitted, allowing my consciousness to communicate discoveries that even most Immortal Six would consider radical. <What appeared as fracturing of Tikal into competing courts actually represented something your ancestors understood intuitively: unified consciousness can manifest across individual carriers while maintaining distinct processing capacities specific to each.>

<Our medieval ancestors didn't experience rivalry but collaboration.> Sorenson realized, her cybernetic systems accessing transformation patterns across Commonwealth populations. <Each sister court specialized in particular temporal processing methods that collectively formed a unified awareness exceeding individual limitations.>

A younger Commonwealth engineer with minimal cybernetic enhancement stepped forward with cautious curiosity. <If the current population-wide synchronization represents recollection rather than transformation, then our technological stasis preserved consciousness patterns that Union science considered evolutionary deficit.>

My quantum integration processed her insight, biological mind acknowledging profound implications. <What the Wyrmfolk interpreted as experimental failure when the Three Sisters courts seemingly competed for supremacy actually represented successful testing of distributed temporal consciousness across individual but connected cognitive frameworks.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems accessed historical documentation that Commonwealth cultural institutes had preserved but never fully understood. <Royal chronicles record 'Unity Assemblies' where messengers from each sister court would gather without conventional communication methods—exchanging information through what medieval chroniclers described as 'mental communion' rather than verbal exchange.>

<Your medical facilities currently record increasing neural synchronization across disparate Commonwealth settlements.> I observed, my consciousness extending through the temporal distortion that no longer destabilized Commonwealth systems but rather amplified their effectiveness. <This pattern replicates historical documentation from the Three Sisters period when separate royal courts accessed unified temporal awareness without proximity.>

<The anomaly.> Sorenson realized, her cybernetic systems detecting patterns that had remained incomprehensible until now. <It's not transforming our populations but rather completing Unity Assembly protocols interrupted when the Wyrmfolk withdrew their magical observation systems during our medieval period.>

I extended awareness toward what Commonwealth medical science now identified as population-wide neural alignment, observing through both Union quantum frameworks and Commonwealth sequential processing. What emerged sent unexpected tremors through my consciousness—not merely confirmation of distributed consciousness but recognition that Unity Assembly protocols had been transmitted through biological inheritance rather than technological interface.

<The royal daughters' descendants carried dormant Unity Assembly activation patterns through medieval generations following Wyrmfolk withdrawal.> I transmitted, allowing my quantum integration to process data that even I had not anticipated when entering the Commonwealth facility. <What your historians described as mythic references to temporal unity actually represented neurological structures preserved across centuries despite technological stasis.>

<Our medical facilities now detect three distinct activation patterns but no hierarchical arrangement between them.> Sorenson reported, her professional composure maintained despite magnitude of discovery about her civilization's identity. <Each operates with equivalent complexity while accessing synchronized information that transcends individual processing limitations.>

I extended consciousness toward Unity Assembly protocols becoming active across Vikatorūan populations, observing through both biological patterns and quantum awareness. What I discovered sent unexpected tremors through me—recognition that the anomaly wasn't external force awakening dormant potentials but rather Vikatorūan consciousness itself completing protocols that had been transmitted through genetic inheritance across centuries.

<During medieval Three Sisters assemblies.> I transmitted slowly, choosing words carefully to avoid creating unnecessary psychological distress. <What appeared as political competition between royal courts actually represented experimental testing of how distinct temporal processing methods might operate individually while accessing unified consciousness.>

The older Commonwealth engineer accessed restricted royal archives through interface protocols our teams had established. <The royal daughters maintained separate courts but documented regular communication through what our chroniclers called 'mental communion'—exchanging information without proximity or conventional transmission methods.>

<Precisely.> I confirmed, allowing my biological mind to process patterns that resonated with memories from my own ascension protocols. <What your medieval ancestors experienced as Unity Assembly capabilities represents distributed consciousness that contemporary Union science has attempted to replicate through technological interface rather than biological evolution.>

Sorenson's cybernetic systems accessed population-wide neurological data flowing into Commonwealth medical networks. <Current transformation patterns don't create uniform consciousness across populations but rather maintain individual differentiation while establishing synchronization channels that exceed what our medical science identifies as possible through neurology alone.>

<The anomaly isn't transforming your people but rather facilitating Unity Assembly completion.> I transmitted carefully, allowing my consciousness to process implications that challenged fundamental Union assumptions about evolution and consciousness. <What the Wyrmfolk observed as historical regression when Unity Assembly patterns diminished following their withdrawal actually represented your ancestors preserving dormant protocols for eventual activation through biological inheritance.>

A Commonwealth engineer with minimal cybernetic enhancement stepped forward cautiously. <If our ancestors achieved Unity Assembly capabilities through biological evolution rather than technological interface, then current population-wide adaptation might exceed what contemporary Union science can artificially replicate.
