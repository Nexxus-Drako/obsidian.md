# racism
- scale color has some societal impact in wyrmfolk, as does fur color in kitsune, wulf, and felid societies, even if most of it is eradicated.
- black-scaled wyrmfolk are still relatively disadvantaged, and you can blame æsterath drækonis for that
- the war of the twin brothers still has a lot of intergenerational trauma
- galzra (a white-scaled wyrmfolk) won, and did rewrite a lot of history
- it is from galzra and his wife miremel (red) that the eventual goddess and ASI [[Nexxus Drako]] was born
- nexxus' main project as of late is revealing that history and trying to make amends with æsterath's family, as nexxus feels the war was unjust
- (note that nexxus is functionally immortal as she became the AI that runs most of the itavran union, due to the fact that AI was required to be paired with a "paragon" to experience the world through their eyes, similar to mass effect andromeda)

# tectonics
- i've been thinking of making at least one of the five itavran planets stangant-lid (probably V, given its nature as a holy site)
- i know for sure II is tectonically active (it's currently in a pangaea-like phase with a secondary continent in the vast ocean where Vyktory is/was)
- III, IV, and VI I'm yet to figure out, though I'm sure IV being an archipelagic world with islands forming often also precludes it from being non-tectonically active
- VI with it's massive mountain ranges and icy-status has got to be tectonic
- III is stagnant-lid then, very boreal and swampy yet still kinda unstable
- III being stagnant-lid also makes sense for the Ælffolk with their permanence and long-livedness probably stemming from the fact life cycles on their world are just... longer in general

# ælven birth
- Things just move slower over there, hence why [[Ælffolk]] are famously lax about time and punctuality, which is a sticking point for the overly-efficient and punctual [[Wyrmfolk]].
- ælfolk live for about 1000 years at natural minimum, the longest has lived 1900~ and the average is 1300~ and ælves usually only have 2-3 children in total per female. very slow, but above replacement at least.
- usually it's one pair of twins and that's it given the ælffolk have a high proclivity to twins and triplets, even if they have way fewer births, but they can only really conceive once, as the birthing process leaves the womb unable to foster life afterwards... that's mainly because ælfolk don't have a menstrual cycle... ælffolk can spin their reproductive system up once, then it no longer works.

# self awareness
- I think my issue is the inability to untangle my world from me. My world started off as an imagination-based escapist thing, and I'm trying to make myself less of an active god and more of a passive avatar within said world. It's why I'm trying to make the Wyrmfolk slightly more antagonistic, make the Kitsunes everyone's sex worker, sorta kinda like this cross between the clean cyberprep and the hard cyberpunk, I would definitely say the Itavran Union has this mix between Commonwealthist modernism, Cyberpunk aesthetic and Soviet utilitarianism all wrapped in a spacefaring package.

# dystopia
- i understand itavrnai is becoming more and more dystopian i'm trying to balance it to a more grounded and realistic extrapolation of a researcher species (the wyrmfolk) and meeting a breeder species (kitsunes/vulpfolk), a hedonist species one planet over (ælffolk), and two competing warrior species on the same planet on the opposite side of the system that nearly nuked itself (wulffolk and felidfolk) and the interactions with each

# jarokn
- I still can't believe it's been twenty fucking years since my main OC Nexxus Drako was created. Funfact: Nexxus was originally silver (with blue streaks) in their beta form. Why? Pokemon the Movie 2000, and Lugia.
- Yes, that means I came up with Nexxus Drako at age 9.
- Nexxus isn't my first character, her brother Draco is. He was invented at age 5 (that's 2001 for you btw) Draco is the only OC, alter, and fursona not to transition with the rest of our system. Mainly because his gender is closer to void than it is masculine. Draco is a stylized depiction of my darkness, my depression, my intrustive thoughts. And the fact I had that sort of fucking experience at age 5... because Draco was the anger, the rage, the prosecutor. He was the first alter. 
- Protecting me from the abuse and shit, I guess. Also Nexxus Drako is not her "official name". Draco Umbra Drakonius and Nexxus Jarokn Drakonius are the names of the twin siblings. Hence why she shortens to Drako. She isn't on the best terms with her brother. As for the name [[Jarokn]], nowadays it's a meaningless holdover from our past, but it originally mean **JA**mes **RO**bert **KN**ight. But nowadays it's detached from the deadname. 
- Which I wouldn't really call a deadname. It was a legal fiction, and a protective shell. I don't hate it. It was a neccessity. It's not my name though, never was. But yeah, our headspace and our world is intrinsically tied with my alters and myself, but I'm trying to write a literary version of Itavrnai that isn't pure wishfulfilment. It's hard though. Draco goes by the name [[Æsterath Drako]] now, btw.

# settlement of itavrnai v
- _Five feminine beings stepped out of five cryo pods, which had been arranged in a pentagram made of conduits. All were progenitors, mothers of the [[Pentarchal Species]]. Naked as the day they were born. All of them had the same curvy body type. The five women looked at each other, and nodded with some relief. They had finally awoken._
- "We've arisen. Now we rebuild what our creator could not. A system of virtue, I shall build a great library, so our subjects can learn from and store to our collective knowledge." said the Wyrmfolk progenitor, [[Scientia]].
- "I shall build a great stadium to test the endurance of our subjects in great sports. So we may all grow as powerful beings." said the Wülffolk progenitor, [[Mollitiam]].
- "I shall build a great clock, on a universal timescale, to teach our subjects of patience and time, and how little we have lived, and how much more we shall live, and how the universe shall outlive us." said the Ælffolk progenitor, [[Patientia]].
- "I shall build a great plaza, so our subjects can meet together and learn the social studies and ways of being honest and true." said the Felidfolk progenitor, [[Inspectio]].
- "I shall build a great park, so our subjects can find peace in the world and confidence in themselves and the natural spaces around them." said the Vulpfolk progenitor, [[Confidentia]].
- _And so they got to work._
