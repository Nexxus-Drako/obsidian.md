# Pyra Drake: A Comprehensive Biography
## The Multifaceted Creative Behind Nexxus Drako

*An Autistic Trans Woman, Creative Polymath, and Digital-Age Renaissance Figure*

**Compiled by Projekt Kalliope | January 2026**

---

## Overview

Pyra Drake is a 29-year-old Brisbane-based autistic trans woman operating as **Nexxus Drako**—indie game developer, electronic musician, game modder, worldbuilder, streamer, graphic design student, and recently licensed amateur radio operator (VK4PKD, VK4UWU). Her practice is distinguished by thematic coherence across diverse media: systems thinking, progression mechanics, community authenticity, and the integration of lived experience (trauma, neurodivergence, plurality) into artistic work of profound integrity.

Drake maintains learning in public under CC-BY-NC-SA licensing, treating vulnerability and creative exploration as valuable rather than limiting. Her work demonstrates that marginalized creatives—trans, autistic, plural, managing serious psychiatric illness—can build authentic, meaningful creative practice on their own terms, while simultaneously remaining radically honest about the crises, incarceration, and ongoing struggles that mark their trajectory.

## Part One: Origins and Formation (1996–2018)

### Birth and Family: Melbourne, March 31, 1996, 3:13 AM

Drake entered the world at **William Angliss Hospital in Melbourne at 3:13 AM on March 31, 1996**, born as James Robert Knight to her mother **Del (b. 1971)** and an absent biological father. This specific moment—this exact date and time—would later achieve profound significance within Drake's collaborative worldbuilding project, the Itavran Union, where the Avatar of the Creator is described as having been born at precisely this moment, reincarnating the progenitor figure responsible for creating the five pentarchal goddesses. The synchronicity suggests the degree to which Drake's personal biography and her fictional worldbuilding have become interwoven, each informing and validating the other.

Drake grew up in a household of profound precarity. Her mother raised three boys—James (Drake), **Brian (b. 1999)**, and **Joshua (b. 2002)**—under circumstances marked by financial instability, emotional chaos, and systemic failure to provide adequate support for a neurodivergent child. Del herself struggled with **untreated bipolar disorder and marijuana dependency**; her social network consisted primarily of friends who were also her dealers, creating an environment where substance use was normalized and integrated into everyday social structure. The household was characterized not by malice but by chronic under-resourcing: a single mother managing the care of three children while navigating her own mental health crises and substance dependency, attempting to survive in a system that provided minimal support for exactly her circumstances.

### The Absent Father and the Trust Fund Betrayal

Drake's biological father remains largely unknown to her—a wealthy businessman who owns a luxury horsefloat business in outer eastern Melbourne. Their union occurred at a casual gathering: a single encounter at the 21st birthday celebration of one of Del's friends, resulting in Drake's conception but generating no ongoing relationship or paternal engagement. The only material manifestation of his existence in Drake's life was a **trust fund with $1,000 weekly deposits**—a substantial sum that represented genuine financial support, yet one that came without any personal connection, without paternal presence, without the relational care that children require alongside material resources.

For Drake, this financial support meant stability, possibility, hope. Yet in **2009, during the Black Saturday bushfires**—an apocalyptic fire event that burned across Victoria, claiming 173 lives and destroying hundreds of thousands of hectares—Drake's father suffered significant loss. He lost his home to the fires. And rather than absorbing that loss as the cost of his wealth and privilege, he made a choice: **he emptied Drake's trust fund to rebuild his own house**.

Drake's own experience of Black Saturday was harrowing. Her family lived in circumstances where they were surrounded by fire on multiple fronts. They had "3 fire fronts east, north, and south of us at a minimum 8kms distance" and were "under ember attack"—meaning that burning embers from distant fires were falling around their property, creating constant danger of secondary ignition. This was not abstract fear but immediate, embodied danger: the knowledge that fire could arrive at their door, that the perimeter of safety was narrowing, that evacuation might become necessary at any moment.

Her younger brother **Brian was hit in the helmet by a chunk of burnt wood** while the siblings were riding BMX and all-terrain scooters, trying to process the apocalypse through childhood activity. The force of impact was sufficient to **melt the helmet**—evidence of the intensity of heat being carried by flying debris. This is childhood trauma of a specific and visceral kind: the knowledge that the landscape itself had become hostile, that play had become dangerous, that the elements were conspiring to harm.

And in the midst of this family crisis, during this moment when the landscape was burning around them and their survival was uncertain, Drake's father made the decision to take the one resource—the $1,000 weekly trust fund—that had provided Drake's family with a modicum of stability and redirect it to rebuilding his own wealth. The economic inequality inscribed in this moment is stark: his wealth and business meant he had insurance, credit, the capacity to rebuild. Drake's family had the trust fund. By taking it, he essentially transferred the cost of his loss onto the already-precarious family of his child.

Drake notes simply: this was an experience that "barely survived as we had 3 fire fronts east, north, and south of us at a minimum 8kms distance." The matter-of-factness of the statement masks the intensity of the experience. This was not a close brush with danger but rather a prolonged state of acute threat, a landscape transformed into hostile terrain, the knowledge that death was a present possibility.

### Geographic Itinerancy: Pre-Memory Movements

Before Drake's conscious memory begins, her family underwent multiple relocations. These early moves established a pattern of instability that would characterize her childhood and adolescence:

- **Mooroolbark** (late 1990s): Early childhood relocation, pre-memory
- **Albury, NSW** (late 1990s): Another early move, pre-memory
- **Wandin North** (late 1990s): Where Kevin's mother resided; early childhood stay, pre-memory. Drake's integration with Kevin's family appears to have been established through residential proximity to his mother, suggesting a particular kind of enmeshment where Kevin's extended family structures became part of Drake's early world.

These three moves occurred entirely before Drake developed autobiographical memory, suggesting that they left traces in her nervous system and embodied experience even as they remain inaccessible to conscious recollection. The peripatetic childhood established early patterns of displacement, the knowledge at some pre-linguistic level that home was temporary, that stability was contingent, that one's living circumstances could change without warning or consent.

### Kevin: Abusive Stepfather and the Enforcement of Gender Conformity

Into this household of precarity stepped **Kevin (b. mid-1970s)**, a man whose presence would be marked by **profound physical and emotional abuse specifically targeted at Drake's gender non-conformity**. Kevin's abusiveness was not generalized but rather focused with devastating precision on one specific aspect of Drake's identity: her refusal to conform to masculine presentation and behavior.

Drake describes the abuse with characteristic restraint and understatement: "he was really insistent on me not doing girl things, to put it extremely lightly." The vagueness of this formulation—"to put it extremely lightly"—is itself revelatory. Trauma survivors, particularly those whose trauma is ongoing or systemic, often resort to understatement as a coping mechanism. By describing abuse in deliberately vague or diminished language, the speaker creates psychological distance from the violence, allows themselves to continue existing in proximity to the trauma without being overwhelmed by it. Yet this same linguistic strategy paradoxically emphasizes the severity of harm by suggesting that direct language would be insufficiently bearable, that the actual experience exceeded what language could safely contain.

The consequence of Kevin's policing of gender non-conformity was profound and totalizing: Drake "just forced herself to mask as male," beginning a **decades-long process of dissociation from her authentic gender identity**. This masking was not a choice in any meaningful sense but rather a **survival adaptation to an impossible situation where authentic self-expression resulted in violence and punishment**. To exist with gender dysphoria while simultaneously being violently punished for any expression of that dysphoria creates a psychological bind: one's internal reality (the knowledge of one's authentic gender identity) becomes incompatible with one's external safety (the requirement to perform maleness to avoid violence). The resolution is dissociation—the fracturing of self into compartments, the suppression of internal knowledge in order to maintain external safety.

This masking was so complete and habitual that Drake would not have language for her own gender dysphoria until adulthood. She had no models for authentic gender expression, no community that validated alternative presentations, no framework for understanding her own experience. Instead, she developed sophisticated strategies for self-suppression, for monitoring her own behavior and self-presentation to ensure compliance with Kevin's demands. The psychological cost of this decades-long surveillance and suppression cannot be overstated. It is a form of violence enacted at the level of the self, a fundamental denial of the possibility of authentic existence.

Kevin's departure from the household came when "he left for Del's best friend Belinda," suggesting a particularly painful form of betrayal where the man who had abused Drake abandoned the family for her mother's closest friend. This abandonment, while removing the immediate source of abuse, could not undo the psychological structures Drake had constructed to survive. The trauma remained inscribed in her nervous system; the patterns of dissociation and self-monitoring persisted; the knowledge that authentic self-expression could result in violence remained deeply embedded.

### Monbulk: Medication Errors and Psychiatric Abandonment

Between Lilydale and Healesville, Drake's family spent approximately **6 months in Monbulk**, a transitional period during which her mother employed an unusual and somewhat controversial strategy. Del **deliberately refused to pay rent** in order to be blacklisted and thus qualify for public housing. This decision suggests a particular kind of desperate pragmatism: Del understood the housing system well enough to manipulate it, to use non-payment as a strategy for accessing government support. It also suggests the depth of the family's financial precarity: that deliberately incurring debt and institutional sanction was preferable to the alternative.

During this Monbulk period, Drake was prescribed **haloperidol**, a first-generation antipsychotic medication commonly used to treat psychotic symptoms and other psychiatric conditions. Yet Drake was apparently responsible for administering her own medications—a startling fact that raises questions about the adequacy of supervision and care in the household. The tragedy that occurred was entirely preventable: Drake **mistakenly took five full 5mL doses of haloperidol instead of a single dose**, resulting in severe extrapyramidal symptoms—a constellation of movement disorders characterized by muscle rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and other involuntary movements. These symptoms are acutely distressing and physically debilitating; they represent the body's revolt against pharmaceutical intervention, the nervous system expressing protest through involuntary movement.

Del's response to this medication-induced crisis was not to seek immediate medical intervention but rather to **switch Drake's pediatrician**. While this decision might appear pragmatic—perhaps the new pediatrician offered superior care—it also prevented proper assessment of the accidental overdose and its consequences. The medical history of the overdose incident was essentially obscured; the new pediatrician would lack context for Drake's acute movement disorder, potentially leading to misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment. Yet Drake notes with characteristic generosity that the new pediatrician was "brilliant, he put me on risperidone immediately and fixed my medication-induced palsy and extrapyramidal symptoms." This suggests that despite the confusion and chaos of the transition, Drake eventually accessed appropriate psychiatric care that successfully reversed the iatrogenic harm caused by the haloperidol overdose.

### Conscious Memory Begins: Lilydale (2000–2003)

Lilydale, a rural exurb east of Melbourne, marks the beginning of Drake's autobiographical memory. From approximately age 4 onwards, Drake has conscious recollection of her life, yet those recollections are often marked by pain, disorientation, and the lingering effects of earlier trauma that had occurred before she had language to process it.

### Healesville (2003–2005): The Yarra Ranges Ecology

Healesville, a small town in the Yarra Ranges region of Victoria, represented another chapter in Drake's itinerant childhood. The Yarra Ranges are characterized by mountain ash forests, mountain streams, and the particular ecology of southeastern Victoria. This landscape would inscribe itself into Drake's sensory memory, becoming the geographic anchoring point for some of her deepest childhood experiences.

### Woori Yallock (2005–2010): Yarraview Reserve and Systematic Violence

Woori Yallock, another town in the Yarra Ranges, became the geographic center of some of Drake's most traumatic childhood experiences. The town itself was unremarkable; what made it significant was the site of systematic violence Drake experienced there—**Yarraview Reserve**, officially designated, but known to Drake as "the Woori Yallock park," located on Middleton Drive around the corner from her old house.

Drake describes returning repeatedly to Yarraview Reserve, despite the violence that awaited her there. This is not the narrative of a resilient child simply overcoming adversity, but rather a more complex portrait of **autistic commitment to fairness and justice becoming a vulnerability in violent contexts**. Drake had "every right to be there alongside the other kids," and the injustice of being violently excluded from public space, of being systematically driven away from childhood, drove her back repeatedly despite the violence. She describes this recurring return as stemming from her "overtuned sense of justice"—the autistic characteristic whereby fairness and rules and justice assume paramount importance, overwhelming other considerations including personal safety.

The violence at Yarraview Reserve was systematic and multi-form: **verbal abuse, physical beatings, and sexual assault**. The sexual assault in particular represents a distinct and severe form of trauma—childhood sexual violence marking her body and consciousness during critical developmental periods when she lacked frameworks for understanding what was happening to her, lacked support systems to process the violation, lacked permission to be angry or to seek help.

What is particularly striking about Drake's description of these experiences is the clarity with which she recalls them—the specific geographic location (Middleton Drive, around the corner from her house), the repeated cycles of return despite trauma. This is evidence of Drake's **eidetic memory and hyperphantasia** (extreme visual memory and ability to reconstruct three-dimensional mental imagery). Drake can close her eyes and reconstruct memories in complete sensory-spatial detail—not merely seeing them but experiencing them: the light, the texture of surfaces, the spatial relationships between objects, the embodied feeling of being in that particular location. This extraordinary gift—the capacity to reconstruct experience with vivid completeness—becomes a double-edged sword in the context of trauma. The same capacity that allows her to navigate complex spatial systems, design sophisticated game environments, and reconstruct maps from memory also means that traumatic memories are preserved with an intensity and sensory completeness that many neurotypical people do not experience.

The systematic nature of the violence at Yarraview Reserve, combined with the school bullying Drake experienced from "students and teachers"—a particularly devastating form of institutional violence where those responsible for her education and safety participated in her persecution—created conditions for the development of complex mental health conditions. The early-childhood autism (diagnosed at age 3) combined with unrecognized gender dysphoria, unprocessed trauma, the absence of any protective structures or safe spaces, and the parental abuse around gender non-conformity created a constellation of conditions that would later manifest as Complex PTSD, Schizophrenia, and Dissociative Identity Disorder.

### Neurodiversity and Diagnostic Constellation

**Age 3**: **Asperger's Syndrome diagnosis**—a relatively early diagnosis for the 1990s, suggesting that Drake's autistic presentation was sufficiently pronounced or visible that parents and medical professionals recognized it. Yet diagnosis alone, particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s, often came without meaningful support, without accommodation, without genuine understanding of what autism meant for development, learning, and social engagement.

**2019**: **Bipolar Type II diagnosis**—a misdiagnosis that persisted for years despite being fundamentally inaccurate. This misdiagnosis represents a significant failure of psychiatric evaluation, suggesting that the clinicians involved failed to adequately differentiate between the mood symptoms associated with trauma and complex psychiatric illness and the specific phenomenology of bipolar disorder.

**2021 onwards**: Full diagnostic clarification—**ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, Complex PTSD, Dissociative Identity Disorder**. Additionally, Drake experiences:

- **Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA)**: A profile of autism characterized by extreme anxiety in response to perceived demands or perceived control. For Drake, this manifests as near-crippling difficulty with tasks that feel imposed from outside, even when she intellectually understands the necessity of the task. The demand itself activates anxiety at a level disproportionate to the actual difficulty of the task.

- **Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)**: An acute sensitivity to perceived rejection or criticism that can trigger intense emotional responses. For Drake, this means that social rejection—perceived or actual—can trigger disproportionate emotional reactions including shame, rage, or complete emotional shutdown.

- **Eidetic memory and hyperphantasia**: Extraordinary capacity to reconstruct memories in complete sensory-spatial detail; ability to close her eyes and experience a "3D movie" of past experiences or dream scenarios or mental maps of places she knows.

- **Déjà rêvé**: Sensation that current waking experience matches a previous dream; occurs with notable frequency for Drake, suggesting unusual integration between dream-consciousness and waking consciousness.

These diagnoses represent the "long tail of trauma, neurodivergence, and the particular ways that undiagnosed autism in childhood can lead to the development of trauma responses, dissociative conditions, and psychotic symptoms." That Drake had "signs but no language for it from age 5 onwards" speaks to the profound gap between the reality of her experience and the availability of understanding, support, or intervention. The specific trauma of childhood sexual assault, combined with systematic bullying and parental abuse around gender non-conformity, created conditions for the development of complex mental health conditions that would mark her entire adult life. The particular vulnerability of autistic people to psychotic breaks, particularly when combined with gender dysphoria, trauma, and sustained masking, appears to be a factor in Drake's schizophrenic symptomatology.

### Academic Achievement Amid Chaos

Notably, amid the chaos of childhood trauma and systemic bullying, Drake achieved notable academic recognition. In approximately 6th grade (ages 11–12), Drake "received a **Credit on a UNSW Year 6 computing exam**"—University of New South Wales' gifted student program competition. Achieving a Credit (the second-highest grade possible) on a university-level computing exam as a primary school student speaks to substantial technical and logical reasoning capacity, even while she was internally struggling with profound dysphoria and trauma. This achievement demonstrates that neurodivergence, trauma, and exceptional capability can coexist; the same autistic mind that was being bullied and abused was simultaneously engaging with sophisticated computational thinking.

Drake also participated in **chess tournaments during 6th grade**. The chess tournament standings, preserved in her archival records, show Drake competing alongside her peers, ranked **19th in a tournament field** of primary school students from Woori Yallock Primary School and surrounding areas. Chess, like orienteering, requires the kind of systematic thinking, pattern recognition, and strategic foresight that characterizes Drake's cognitive approach.

### The Orienteering Championship and "The James Knight Laws"

In approximately **2010 or 2011**, Drake participated in an **orienteering competition** organized by her school district. Orienteering—the sport of navigating point-to-point courses through unfamiliar terrain using only map and compass—requires precisely the kind of systematic thinking and pattern recognition that characterizes Drake's creative approach. One navigates not by knowing the terrain but by understanding the principles of navigation itself: how to read symbols, how to plot progress, how to remain oriented even when disoriented.

Drake describes her participation with characteristic sardonic understatement: "it was a free activity and i thought 'screw it, i may as well get out of class.'" Her best friend at the time, **Mark**, who was "more needy on the spectrum than herself," followed her into the competition despite entering after her. The competition was closely contested: despite Drake's deliberate running strategy to create distance, they "clocked the same time," with Mark receiving a two-minute penalty because Drake's integration aide (her 1:1 tutor) made inquiries to the arbiter about circumstances, allowing Drake to officially win.

This victory positioned both friends to advance to the state competition, but **funding cuts meant the district where they were competing could no longer afford to host private entries**. Drake's competitive orienteering career ended there, truncated by structural resource constraints beyond her control. The experience of winning at the district level, then having the opportunity to advance foreclosed by institutional resource failure, is a particular kind of disappointment—not personal inadequacy but systemic limitation.

Yet the most significant aftermath of Drake's school experience was not related to orienteering but to her broader educational needs. Drake notes that she "learned recently that her suffering at school caused the Victorian Education Department to revamp the entire rules and regulations around autistic students" in what is "internally called **'The James Knight Laws.'**"

This is a remarkable statement, one that deserves careful consideration. Drake is suggesting that the extreme difficulties she experienced in the Victorian education system—the bullying, the trauma, the failure of institutional systems to protect or support her—were sufficiently egregious and well-documented that they prompted systemic policy change. That this policy change was named after her (even internally, even unofficially) suggests a recognition, at some level within the education bureaucracy, that her experience represented a failure of the system severe enough to warrant institutional transformation.

This is a strange form of legacy—to have one's suffering become the impetus for systemic change, to have one's childhood trauma inscribed into policy and procedure. It is not a legacy Drake appears to have sought or even fully registered until years later. Yet it represents something important: the recognition that individual suffering, when sufficiently visible and sufficiently egregious, can become a catalyst for institutional transformation.

### Healesville Redux (2010–2018): Adolescence and Alternative Communities

Drake returned to Healesville for her adolescent years, the period during which she would begin to construct alternative communities and explore identity possibilities outside the constraints of family trauma. During this period, she engaged with tabletop gaming communities, online gaming, and the development of gaming infrastructure that would characterize her creative practice.

### Albury, NSW (2017–2021): TAFE Education and Early Gender Exploration

At age 21, Drake moved to **Albury, NSW**, a regional city on the Victoria-NSW border. This relocation represented a significant geographical and psychological shift—movement away from the towns of her childhood trauma, entry into a new community with fresh social possibilities. It was during her Albury years that Drake would pursue formal vocational education and begin public exploration of gender beyond strict maleness.

## Part Two: Online Identity and Early Creative Work (2005–2021)

### Jarokn (2005–2018): Childhood Refuge in Digital Space and Archival Traces

At age 9, in 2005, Drake created **Jarokn**, her first significant online identity. The name's origin is transparently biographical—derived from the first two letters of "**James**" and "**Robert Knight**," combined into a compressed, restructured signifier. This is not elaborate persona-crafting or mythological reference but rather straightforward linguistic manipulation: take the materials available (her given name), compress and rearrange them, and create something that felt "distinctly *theirs* rather than imposed by circumstance or authority."

Jarokn emerged as a **Hotmail address**, the digital signifier through which a nine-year-old Drake could inhabit online space. In the early-to-mid 2000s, online gaming communities—particularly around games like Neopets (a browser-based pet simulation game that was extraordinarily popular among children during this period)—represented one of the few spaces where a young person could construct alternative identities with minimal verification, where presentation of self could be entirely self-determined, where gender was performative and optional rather than mandated and enforced.

The preservation of Jarokn's early digital presence in internet archives allows for documentation of Drake's early creative trajectory. The Wayback Machine captures provide evidence of Drake's technical engagement from childhood:

- **Jarokn.com** (captured November 14, 2011): Early web presence using free hosting
- **Jarokn.tripod.com** (captured March 3, 2018): Another free hosting platform presence
- **DeviantArt account as Jarokn**: Early participation in online art communities
- **Jarokn.wordpress.com** and **jarokngames.wordpress.com**: Wordpress blogs documenting gaming projects
- **YouTube channel**: Video documentation of gaming and creative work
- **GitHub repositories** (jarokngames): Early open-source contributions

These archival traces reveal a young person engaged with game design, game modification, tool-building, and systems creation from remarkably early age. Drake created sophisticated fantasy worldbuilding projects within existing game engines (FM14 North Rona Fantasy Mod, FM15 Saxon Super League, FM15 Surrey Super League), demonstrating early expertise in systems design and world-building that would eventually find fuller expression in the Itavran Union.

**Gaming as Refuge**: Drake notes that gaming "was one of the few spaces where a young person struggling with gender dysphoria and neurological difference could inhabit alternative presentations of self without the immediate social consequences that attended such experimentation in the material world." This is not nostalgic romanticization but accurate description: online spaces in the early-to-mid 2000s, particularly gaming communities, offered genuine refuge for gender-non-conforming youth, neurodivergent youth, and all youth whose identities or presentations did not align with normative expectations. For Drake, online gaming was not mere entertainment but literal survival—a space where she could exist differently, where the enforced masking that Kevin had imposed could be temporarily suspended, where alternative versions of self could be explored and expressed.

### Youth Project Archaeology: Early Creative Work in Detail

The archival documentation of Jarokn's creative work reveals a sophisticated young creator engaging with diverse gaming and systems design projects:

**Cricket Simulations**: Jarokn-Cricket, king-ace-cricket—tools for cricket enthusiasts
**Tactical Games**: Jarokn-Battle—turn-based combat systems
**Football Management Games**: FM14 North Rona Fantasy Mod, FM15 Saxon Super League, FM15 Surrey Super League—elaborate fantasy worldbuilding projects set within Sports Interactive's football management engine, suggesting early experimentation with systems design, narrative world-building, and the integration of complex rule systems with imaginative geography
**Scoring and Leaderboard Applications**: Open Leaderboard App, AussieRulesCoach, FreeOpenCricketSim, Leagion-Scorinator—tools for tracking competitive gameplay and community engagement
**Space Game Modifications**: Kerbal Space Program (KSP) modifications—sophisticated mods for a complex physics-based space simulation
**Transport Simulation**: Transport Tycoon Deluxe forum participation—engagement with community around the classic economic simulation
**Open Source Contributions**: Launchpad projects (AussieRulesCoach, FreeOpenCricketSim), early GitHub contributions

This early period demonstrates Drake's consistent preoccupation with **systems, rules, progression, and community**. Rather than creating standalone narratives or artistic works, Drake focused on creating tools and systems that would allow others to engage with games in more sophisticated ways, that would enable community organization and competitive play, that would facilitate the kinds of collaborative worldbuilding that she herself found meaningful.

### Healesville LAN Tournaments (2011): Tournament Design and Community Infrastructure

While Jarokn represented Drake's online presence, her offline gaming community in Healesville developed in parallel. During her 2010–2018 residence in Healesville, Drake and her friends—a community of young gamers, many neurodivergent themselves—constructed their own gaming infrastructure. Specifically, Drake organized **Halo Reach LAN tournaments**: in-person, local area network competitions on Halo Reach (a 2010 Xbox 360 first-person shooter) held in someone's house, with friends competing across multiple television screens and Xbox 360 consoles.

The structure of these tournaments reveals Drake's early sophistication with game design and community management. Each tournament consisted of **four teams of four players**, with each team playing on a dedicated screen to prevent "screencheating" (the practice of looking at another player's screen to gain advantage). Participants paid **$20 to enter**, with the entry fees divided: half ($10) went into a "pizza party fund" to provide food for participants, while the other half ($10 per person) funded the competitive prize pool.

The prize pool distribution was precisely calculated:
- **Winner: $80** (recovers 8× entry fee, substantial reward for first place)
- **Runner-up: $40** (recovers 4× entry fee, meaningful second-place prize)
- **Semi-finalists: $20 each** (recovers 2× entry fee, ensuring that making top-4 recovers entry fee)

This structure meant that the top two finishers would recover or exceed their entry fee, creating an incentive structure that rewarded competition while ensuring that **participation in the tournament itself generated community value through the shared pizza meal** regardless of competitive outcome. The entire tournament was managed "on pen and paper," with no digital infrastructure—a remarkable level of manual organization for what would have been approximately 2011, before widespread digital tools for tournament management were readily available to teenagers.

This early tournament structure reveals something crucial about Drake's approach to community and systems: even as a teenager, she was thinking systematically about **incentives, fairness, and the structures that would encourage genuine competition while maintaining community cohesion**. The distribution of prize money (designed so that finalists would recover their entry fee, while the winner received significantly more) reflects careful thinking about how to make competition both genuinely competitive and sustainable over time. The anti-screencheating measures reflect commitment to fair play and integrity. The integration of community-building (pizza party) with competitive play reflects understanding that the value of tournament participation extends beyond monetary prizes to include social connection and shared experience. The entire enterprise—organized by hand, run with friends, powered by enthusiasm rather than commercial motivation—represents an early model for the kind of community-building Drake would later pursue through Nexxus Drako Gaming and other projects.

### Cryptoassets and Early Blockchain Engagement (2010)

In 2010, Drake became an early cryptocurrency adopter, acquiring **1.5 Bitcoin (BTC)** at ground-floor prices. At the time, Bitcoin was nascent and speculative, traded at prices far below its eventual valuation. Yet Drake's cryptocurrency holding was not long-lived. She eventually sold her 1.5 BTC for **$100**—a transaction that would eventually represent extraordinary opportunity cost (1.5 BTC would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars by 2024).

What is significant is Drake's stated reflection on this decision: "I never regretted it as the crypto space filled with fascists and scammers." This statement reveals Drake's consistent ethical orientation: she prioritizes community integrity and ethical positioning over financial gain. Rather than maintaining her crypto holdings hoping for appreciable increase, she exited the space when she recognized that the community and values she had joined were being corrupted by bad-faith actors. This is not a decision made by calculation of future value but rather by commitment to integrity and recognition that some spaces become uninhabitable for people with certain values.

---

## Part Three: Embodied Practice, Athletic Engagement, and Physical Vulnerability

### Running, Basketball, Soccer, and the June 2025 Knee Injury

Drake "mostly runs and plays basketball or soccer in a local park"—accessible, communal sports rooted in Brisbane community. This athletic engagement is not incidental to her identity but rather central to how she understands herself as an embodied being. Unlike many creative professionals who present themselves as purely digital or imaginative, Drake insists on visibility of her physical embodied practice, her athletic engagement, her movement through space.

Her favorite teams reflect diverse sports codes and geographic regions:
- **Brisbane Lions** (AFL—Australian Rules Football)
- **Brisbane Broncos** (NRL—National Rugby League)
- **Queensland Maroons** (State of Origin rugby league)
- **McLaren F1** (Formula One motor racing)
- **Manchester United** (association football/soccer)

This diversity of interests reflects broad athletic engagement rather than specialization in a single sport or team.

**The City2City 7.5km Walk and Talk (February 17, 2019)**: Drake participated in this race event in Albury:
- **Finish Time**: 1:33:45
- **Placing**: 355/500 (gender), 243/327 (category), 1009/1510 (overall)
- **Pace**: 12:30 min/km
- **Status**: Finished
- **Category**: Open (Mixed)

This documented athletic engagement provides concrete evidence of Drake's embodied, physical self-presentation. The race result demonstrates that Drake engages with embodied physical practice not as escape from her creative and digital work but as integrated aspect of her identity.

**June 2025 Knee Injury and Ongoing Recovery**: Drake experienced a significant fall in June 2025 that resulted in knee injury. In late January 2026, she underwent **MRI imaging** to assess the damage. She notes that she is "over 210kg now" in body weight and "needs to try and get back on the saddle safely, when it heals." This casual statement of current embodied state—the weight, the injury, the ongoing recovery process—speaks to a particular moment in Drake's embodied life where physical limitations are actively shaping what she can do. The commitment to recovery and eventual return to physical activity, despite current constraints, reflects resilience and acceptance of temporary limitation rather than permanent foreclosure.

This attention to embodiment distinguishes Drake from many creative professionals. The body is not incidental to her identity; it is central. The body is trans, is neurodivergent, is recovering from injury, carries weight and trauma and sensation. The integration of this embodied experience with her creative and digital practice represents a distinctive approach to creative identity: one that does not deny or transcend the body, but rather insists on its visibility and value.

## Part Four: Gender Identity, Transition, and the Construction of Authentic Self

### The Dyadic Years and Masked Gender Non-Conformity (1996–2018)

Drake had "signs but no language for it from age 5 onwards"—signs of gender dysphoria, of misalignment between internal identity and external presentation, of the fundamental discomfort that would later be articulated as transgender identity. Yet language did not arrive until age 19, when she began "really questioning" her gender identity. The interim fourteen years represent a period of profound dysphoria without vocabulary, of embodied wrongness without conceptual framework, of living daily life in a state of profound misalignment.

The absence of language was not accidental but structural. Kevin's policing of gender non-conformity meant that Drake could not speak her dysphoria, could not name her experience, could not seek help or understanding. Instead, she internalized the prohibition: she forced herself to mask, to perform maleness, to suppress the aspects of her identity that Kevin had made clear were intolerable. By adolescence, the masking had become habitual and nearly complete—so complete that discovering language for her own gender dysphoria required external catalysts, community, and the eventual development of concepts (plural identity, demigirl, sapphic) that would allow her to articulate her experience.

Drake would later receive a **formal diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria**, which gradually resolved as her hormone replacement therapy took effect, providing both biochemical and psychological alignment with her authentic gender identity. The phenomenology of dysphoria—the specific texture of feeling wrongness in one's body, the particular ways that dysphoria manifests in embodied experience—is not extensively documented in Drake's public materials, suggesting that this remains a private experience, one she has not fully articulated publicly.

### Vyktory Drake and Non-Binary Transition (2018)

In 2018, at age 22, Drake transitioned to a non-binary identity within her board gaming group, adopting the name **Vyktory Drake**. This was not a full social transition, not a legal change, not a public announcement, but rather a localized shift in how she presented herself within a specific community. Vyktory represents a liminal identity—neither fully masculine nor fully feminine, but a deliberate restructuring of the name Drake (which she would retain as a surname) with the stylized spelling "Vyktory" (victory recoded), suggesting triumph or triumph-becoming.

This transition was supported by her board gaming community, suggesting that she had found a space of genuine acceptance and support—a crucial shift from the isolation and bullying of her school years. It was during this period that she met **Lufu**, a friend who would become instrumental in Drake's subsequent transition and her understanding of plural identity. Lufu would help Drake "transition as well as come out as plural," providing both emotional support and conceptual frameworks for understanding her own experience.

The Vyktory identity would persist beyond this initial non-binary transition, eventually becoming the foundation for extensive creative worldbuilding and community projects. The archived evidence of Vyktory's evolution is substantial:
- **Vyktoryan Commonwealth** (Micras platform): A detailed micronation with government structure, history, and political organization
- **M-League participation**: Micronational soccer league competition
- **Micronational Rocket League**: Competitive rocket league participation as a micronation
- **Vyktory Dragons** (Weebly site): Gaming community and clan organization
- **Vyktory ProBoards community**: Forums for community discussion and coordination
- **Vyktoryan Free Press**: Micronational news and media
- **FM2016 Vyktoryan Football Fantasy Nation**: Another fantasy worldbuilding project within football management game engine
- **Micras wiki entries**: Extensive documentation on collaborative worldbuilding platform

These archives reveal that Vyktory was not merely a personal identity but a **framework for extensive creative worldbuilding, community organization, and collaborative fantasy nation-building**.

Yet this relationship with Lufu, while transformative, would eventually end in ways that caused Drake significant pain. Drake describes how Lufu later "left my community over personal issues irreconcilable with me. I still hate that I hurt her via extreme traumadumping in a dark time." This brief statement contains within it a recognition of Drake's own responsibility in the relationship's dissolution, an acknowledgment of how her own struggles—her trauma, her unprocessed pain, her neurodivergent communication patterns—can affect others. It speaks to a kind of moral maturity and self-awareness, even as it registers the genuine loss and pain of the relationship's ending.

### The Pyra Transition: Legal Recognition and HRT (September–November 2021)

In mid-2021, at age 25, Drake underwent what would be her most legally and medically formalized transition. In **September 2021**, she legally changed her name from James Robert Knight to **Pyra Drake** and updated her sex marker on legal documents. In **November 2021**, she began **hormone replacement therapy (HRT)**. These were not simultaneous events but sequential: legal recognition preceded medical transition by approximately two months.

The name **Pyra** itself was discovered through years of exploration and experimentation. Drake notes cycling through various names:
- **Sevestra**: Generated from an "elf name generator in 2009," reflecting her engagement with fantasy aesthetics
- **Pyrasaurus, PyraKitsune, CelestialRyuneko**: Intermediate attempts at finding "a fit," exploring different identity possibilities
- **Nexxus Drako**: Eventually settled as professional identifier

Within this process of exploration, **Pyra** emerged as the name that "stuck," the identifier that felt authentically hers. The name references fire, transformation, the alchemical processes of becoming—all concepts that resonated with Drake's understanding of her own identity. **Pyra** is both singular and cosmic: a specific individual (Pyra Drake) and a universal principle (fire, transformation, becoming).

The period from mid-2021 onwards marks a **fundamental shift toward alignment between internal identity and external presentation**. The masking that had begun in childhood began to dissolve. The fragments of identity—Jarokn, Sevestra, Vyktory, the various online aliases—began to consolidate around **Pyra Drake** and the professional identifier **Nexxus Drako**. This consolidation was not a rejection of earlier identities but rather a **clarification, a bringing into focus of authentic self that had been obscured by trauma, by forced masking, by the absence of language**.

## Part Five: Plurality and the System—Non-Pathological Multiplicity

### Understanding Drake's Plurality

In the past five years (roughly 2021 onwards), Drake has come to understand herself as **plural**—as possessing multiple distinct identities or aspects of self within one body, a phenomenon she describes as "multiple selves, divided attention." She maintains a detailed profile on **PluralKit**, a platform specifically designed for plural communities, which documents her system and allows others to interact with different members of her plurality.

Drake's system consists of five identified alters, each with distinctive characteristics and roles:

**Æsterath** (Ælffolk, pronounced "Eh-ster-ath"): The arbiter of justice within the system. Æsterath defends the system and maintains the principles of fairness and right action. The choice of ethereal naming (Æsterath) speaks to a liminal, otherworldly perspective on justice and ethical principles. Æsterath represents the part of Drake that is fundamentally committed to justice, to fairness, to the recognition of wrongdoing and the demand for accountability.

**Kazumi** (Kitsune): The caretaker and comfort of the system, embodying maternal care and compassionate support. The kitsune reference connects to Drake's longstanding therianthropy and spiritual identification with shapeshifting foxes from Japanese mythology. Kazumi represents the capacity for nurturing, for attending to the needs of the system and the individuals within it, for providing comfort and witness to suffering.

**Lilith** (Demon/Succubus): The keeper of desire and meaning-making within the system. Lilith maintains the fires of creative and sexual energy, ensuring that desire and passion inform the system's engagement with the world. Lilith represents the part of Drake that refuses denial, that insists on the validity of desire and passion and sexual energy as legitimate aspects of existence.

**Nexxus** (Dragon): The sociable, outgoing aspect of the system. Nexxus lives, laughs, and loves, and serves as the master of socialization and interpersonal connection. The dragon reference mirrors Drake's professional identifier Nexxus Drako, suggesting integration between system identity and public persona. Nexxus represents the capacity for joy, for connection, for reaching out to others and building relationships.

**Pyra** (Human): The singularity and primary focus, described as "the one creator, the purest essence." Pyra is simultaneously temporal ("time themselves"), spatial ("space herself"), and cosmic ("the universe himself")—a paradoxical identity that contains multitudes. As the human aspect, Pyra represents groundedness and embodied presence, yet simultaneously holds infinite scope.

The five-fold system suggests a **mature, integrated plurality** where different aspects of consciousness have developed specific functions and identities while remaining part of a coherent whole. Plurality, as Drake experiences it, is not a disorder but a **fundamental aspect of how her mind is organized**. While plurality can emerge in response to trauma (as in Dissociative Identity Disorder, which Drake also has a diagnosis for), it also exists as a **non-pathological aspect of identity** for some people.

Drake's sophisticated engagement with her plurality suggests a form of integration that honors the multiplicity of consciousness rather than attempting to collapse it into singular identity. She explicitly maintains detailed boundaries around her system information: what is shared publicly is calibrated to provide representation and connection with plural communities while protecting the privacy and autonomy of each alter. This approach reflects her broader philosophy of learning in public while respecting boundaries—making her experience visible enough to connect with others, while maintaining appropriate integrity of her internal system.

## Part Six: Professional and Creative Development

### Electronic Dance Music: Extrasolar Detonation (2018–present)

**Technological Accessibility Over Artistic Heritage**: Drake discovered electronic dance music production through technological accessibility rather than lifelong passion. She notes: "edm was just easy to make with apple live loops in garageband on my iphone. it takes skill to pick and choose the right loops and when to play them, and tracks can be a bit formulaic, but it's my ambient workflow."

This characterization is revealing: Drake adopts technologies that align with her particular way of thinking and working, that create the least friction between creative impulse and creative output. Garage Band on iPhone, with its pre-constructed loops and emphasis on selection and timing rather than synthesis or sound design, aligned with her "ambient workflow"—a way of working that is generative but not intensely focused, that allows for flow state and intuitive decision-making rather than requiring sustained, directed concentration.

**Extrasolar Detonation** launched in 2018, with the inaugural album "**Experiment 313**" released on **September 24, 2018**. The album contains nine experimental tracks: "Blaming Fran," "Vyktory," "Manic Low," "Everybody Dance," "Making Encina Sad," "Mancunia," "High Mania," "Moonlight," and "Effing the Effing FRC." The track titles suggest personal references, in-jokes with friends, and deliberate engagement with emotional states and creative processes. The album's title, with its reference to laboratory experimentation (Experiment) and the clinical designation "313," establishes the project's orientation toward the playful, the speculative, and the deliberately artificial. (Note: 313 is one of Drake's "arc numbers"—a numeral that appears with notable frequency during significant life events and that Drake associates with schizophrenic episodes and transformative moments.)

**Commercial Performance and Platform Recognition**: The commercial performance of Extrasolar Detonation was respectable, if modest. Some songs achieved "regional Australian number ones in the weekly **Atomic charts**," while two additional tracks reached the **top 20 in the 2019 Atomic 100**. Atomic is the premier Australian platform for regional/rural Australian music, offering both radio play and streaming, representing genuine engagement with Australian audiences for electronic music. The platform exists in an important niche, mediating between underground production and broader listenership, and achieving recognition within Atomic's ecosystem represents meaningful validation of artistic work.

Drake attended some open mic events and local gigs, where she engaged with local musicians and the broader electronic music community. **Atomic even used her music as background music for some videos**—a form of exposure and validation that suggested her work was resonating with the curators and producers who ran the platform. Her presence on ABC Triple J Unearthed (Australia's premier platform for independent music) further suggests recognition within Australian music communities.

**COVID-19 and Interrupted Momentum**: Yet then COVID-19 arrived, and "covid killed all that. still pissed." This casual statement contains within it the particular disappointment of an artist whose trajectory of increasing engagement was abruptly truncated by global pandemic, whose momentum was lost to circumstances entirely beyond her control. The transition from increasing recognition to sudden cessation represents a specific kind of loss.

**Itavrnai Protocol (2025–present)**: In 2025, Drake began working on **Itavrnai Protocol**, explicitly positioned as a reboot and follow-up to Extrasolar Detonation. The first album in this new project, "**Genesys**," is set to release in early 2026. The decision to create a new project under a different name, but explicitly positioned as a "reboot and follow-up," suggests both continuity and evolution—the continuation of Drake's electronic music practice, but with a deliberate marker of new direction and renewed commitment. The choice of "Itavrnai Protocol" as the project name directly references her worldbuilding project, the Itavran Union, suggesting deepening integration between her various creative domains.

### Let's Make a Soccer Team! and the LMAST Realism Mod

**Discovery and Aesthetic Alignment**: In 2007, Drake discovered **Let's Make a Soccer Team! (LMAST)** at a Go-Lo discount store and purchased it, beginning what would become a decades-long engagement with the game. LMAST is a PlayStation 2 football management simulation game developed in Japan, characterized by crude graphics, quirky mechanics, and a profound oddness that has made it a cult object for dedicated gaming communities worldwide.

When asked what drew her to LMAST specifically, Drake simply states: "it just makes my autist brain tick in the right places. i can't explain it more." This statement is revealing: Drake experiences certain games as specifically aligned with how her autistic brain processes information and engagement. The mechanics, the systems, the particular way LMAST structures information—these create a form of resonance, an alignment between her cognitive patterns and the game's design. This is not mere entertainment but a form of genuine cognitive match, the experience of systems and structures that work *with* rather than *against* neurodivergent minds.

**LMAST.Net Community Hub**: Drake's engagement with LMAST evolved into archival and creative work. She created **LMAST.Net** as an unofficial community hub, providing resources and documentation for the dedicated LMAST player base.

**The LMAST Realism Mod**: More significantly, Drake developed the **LMAST Realism Mod**, a comprehensive modification that updates the game's visual systems while preserving its core mechanics. The detailed technical documentation of Drake's work reveals her focus on:

- **Logo replacement**: Replacing unlicensed team logos with real, licensed logos from actual football competitions
- **User interface overhaul**: Modernizing the UI with updated visual design
- **Kit design updates**: Updating team kit designs to match contemporary standards
- **Visual system improvements**: Enhancing graphics and visual presentation while maintaining game compatibility

This work is simultaneously **archival** (preserving an older game from obsolescence), **creative** (redesigning visual systems), and **curatorial** (making choices about what aspects of the original to maintain and what to update).

**Platform Recognition and Legacy**: The LMAST Realism Mod became sufficiently notable that it was briefly listed on the official **Wikipedia article for Let's Make a Soccer Team!**, representing recognition from the broader gaming community of her contribution to digital preservation. The mod has become the definitive modern version of the game for its dedicated community, allowing new players to experience LMAST with updated visual standards while maintaining the game's distinctive mechanics and charm. The mod's existence and active maintenance represent a commitment to digital preservation and community service that goes well beyond what the original developer (who abandoned the game decades ago) ever provided.

### Game Development: Kitsu's Destiny (2015–2022)

**Prototype to Commercial Release**: Kitsu's Destiny was originally developed as "**The Timeless Battle**" back in 2015. Drake has preserved the source code in her Steam workshop and decided to complete the game, enlisting friends as beta testers who "did proper beta testing." Despite not advertising or marketing the game, it achieved significant sales: **over 1,400 units sold**, with continued sales occurring during RPG Maker festivals.

This is remarkable. A game that Drake created without expectation of commercial success, that she did not market, that she released without fanfare, achieved over 1,400 sales. This suggests either that the game had appeal to niche communities that discovered it through algorithmic recommendation, or that Drake's existing audience (from music, streaming, content creation) extended to her games, or some combination thereof. Either way, it represents meaningful commercial success for indie game development, particularly given the lack of marketing effort.

**Formal Innovation: Incremental and Legacy Gameplay**: The game's defining formal innovation is its engagement with "**incremental, legacy-style gameplay**." Incremental games (sometimes called "idle" or "clicker" games) are a specific genre that emerged in the early 2010s, characterized by mechanics in which progress continues even when the player is not actively engaged. The genre is associated with both profound engagement and, by some critics, exploitation—the mechanics are sometimes deliberately designed to compel continued engagement through psychological reward systems.

Placing a game about incremental systems within the formal apparatus of RPG Maker, a tool traditionally associated with narrative-driven role-playing games, represents a deliberate genre-bending. The "legacy-style" component refers to mechanics in which individual runs through the game's content can be reset, with accumulated progress carrying forward to subsequent runs. This mechanic, which originated in roguelike games (particularly *Hades*, which has become a paradigm example), creates a distinctive player psychology: the understanding that loss or reset is not failure, but progression. One advances not through any single playthrough, but across multiple iterations.

**Title Significance**: The title itself is significant. "**Kitsu**" references kitsune, the Japanese mythological figure of the fox-spirit, particularly one capable of shape-shifting. The reference positions the game within anime and Japanese aesthetic communities—communities Drake is part of and engaged with. "**Destiny**," by contrast, suggests fate, predetermined trajectory. The tension between the malleability implied by kitsune and the fixedness implied by destiny creates a productive formal ambiguity at the level of the game's title.

**Design Philosophy and Player Engagement**: When asked about her philosophy of game design, Drake responds simply: "i just prototype games in cool engines and try to make it as easy as possible to iterate on an idea. that's all." This minimalism masks actual sophistication. By prototyping in accessible engines and prioritizing iteration, Drake is prioritizing creative exploration over technical complexity, the generation of ideas over perfection of execution. This philosophy aligns with her broader creative approach: breadth, experimentation, synthesis across media rather than deep specialization within a single domain.

Kitsu's Destiny also demonstrates Drake's engagement with player feedback. Asked about her approach to critical reception, she notes: "i try to listen to all players, even the ones who dislike, and try to take that on board." This commitment to engaging with criticism—even negative criticism—suggests a maturity and openness to feedback that is not always present in indie game development communities.

### Motorsport Manager Revamped: Collaborative Modding and Neurodivergent Community Building

**Jay O'Dowd (Ohayoghurt): Technical Collaborator and Fellow Neurodivergent Creator**: In addition to her original game development, Drake has been actively engaged in game modding communities. **Motorsport Manager Revamped** is a comprehensive mod for Sports Interactive's Motorsport Manager, combining Drake's work with collaborative work by **Jay O'Dowd**, known online as **Ohayoghurt** (note the correction from Ohayebrint).

Jay O'Dowd is not merely a talented game modder but a genuinely exceptional technical mind. His trajectory reveals the particular challenges faced by gifted neurodivergent people navigating trauma and loss:

- **Australian Mathematics Competition accolades**: Won multiple awards and recognitions in primary school, demonstrating exceptional mathematical talent from youth
- **Severe burnout in high school**: Jay "burnt out hard" in high school while dealing with his father's opioid addiction and the deaths of multiple family members
- **Father's death**: Jay's father died of acute opioid overdose in 2016—crucially, Jay was present and in his arms when his father died, making him a witness to the precise moment of paternal loss
- **Grandparents' deaths**: Multiple grandparents died during this same period, compounding the loss and trauma
- **Competitive gaming despite trauma**: Despite these profound losses and the burnout from high school, Jay pursued competitive gaming
- **Semi-professional Gran Turismo eSports status**: Jay achieved competitive status as a Gran Turismo eSports driver, competing in the **2022 Gran Turismo World Series Showdown** at professional level

The collaboration between Drake and O'Dowd represents a meeting of two neurodivergent creatives navigating complex trauma while maintaining sophisticated engagement with systems, mechanics, and competitive gaming. Both are working through the particular challenges of neurodivergence, loss, and the navigation of systems despite internal struggle.

**Motorsport Manager Revamped Details**: The mod creates a "vanilla-plus ramp of the game and its mechanics," enhancing the base game while maintaining its fundamental structure and playability. Motorsport Manager is a motorsport management simulation that, like LMAST, has sustained an engaged modding community. Drake's work on the Motorsport Manager Revamped mod represents another example of her commitment to updating and improving older games within their existing frameworks, to working collaboratively within modding communities, and to making creative contributions that enhance other people's experience of games she cares about.

## Part Seven: The Itavran Union—Collaborative Worldbuilding and Philosophical Integration

### The Itavran Union: Scope and Significance

The Itavran Union represents Drake's most extensive worldbuilding project—"**a space-faring nation with five species from five different planets in the Itavrnai system.**" She describes it as "a worldbuilding project within a private shared universe," suggesting both its sophistication and its status as a collaborative project conducted among intimate communities rather than public broadcast.

Drake maintains "a massive dump of info" on her GitHub, including "Assorted Itavran Verbiage" and "Itavran Chatlogs and Ramblings," technical documentation of worldbuilding that reveals the depth of systematic thinking undergirding the project. The Itavran Union is not a casual fictional setting but rather a rigorously constructed alternate world with its own languages, political structures, species, and histories.

### The Five Pentarchal Species

The five species of the Itavrnai system are each with their own planetary origins, cultural traditions, biological characteristics, and relationships to one another:

**The Wyrmfolk** (Itavrnai II, Wyrmveld): Wingless draconic humanoids who emerged as the dominant species and primary political and military force within the Union. Biologically, Wyrmfolk possess physical strength substantially exceeding their cognitive abilities (roughly average human intelligence). The species maintains a deliberately low natural birth rate but compensates through sophisticated in-vitro fertilization technology, resulting in a predominantly "designer baby" reproductive model. Crucially, Wyrmfolk possess no external genitalia until undergoing a cultural coming-of-age ceremony—a transformative ritual involving twelve-month hibernation in specialized cells that allows individuals to consciously determine their own sexual characteristics and gender presentation. This biological and cultural framework treats gender as a spectrum rather than a binary. Wyrmfolk culture is notably open regarding sexuality and polyamorous relationship structures.

**The Ælffolk** (Itavrnai III, Esmërældus): A long-lived species with natural lifespans ranging from one thousand to nineteen hundred years. The Ælffolk maintain an extremely low birth rate; most females produce only two to three children across their entire lifespan. Crucially, each Ælffolk female can only conceive once; the birthing process causes permanent damage to the reproductive womb, preventing subsequent pregnancies. The species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism in political power, with a roughly 80/20 female-to-male ratio creating a cultural system wherein Ælffolk males achieve "royal importance" by virtue of their rarity. The most famous Ælffolk paternal house is House Rythorn, currently led by Sevestra Rythorn, notable as the first intersex Ælffolk born with both reproductive systems functionally intact.

**The Vulpfolk** (Itavrnai IV, Kunatairō, also known as Kitsunes): Distinguished by an extremely low birth rate coupled with extremely high miscarriage rates. The species compensates for reproductive challenges through extreme libidos, a biological adaptation that has fundamentally shaped Vulpfolk culture and social organization. Vulpfolk mandatory education ends following Junior High (at approximately age fifteen), coinciding with sexual maturity. Rather than continuing academic education, sexually mature Kitsunes transition to breeding responsibilities within their den structure. Kitsune society is entirely organized around breeding dens, each consisting of a queen, three princes, seven maids, and twenty-one drones, with additional residents and workers occupying less structured roles. The Kitsune population has historically been subject to artificial limitation by the Wyrmfolk due to previous overpopulation crises on Kunatairō. Modern Kitsunes frequently emigrate to other planetary systems to work as sex workers, a diaspora that the broader Union tacitly accepts.

**The Wülffolk and Felidfolk** (Itavrnai VI, Syndïlæ): Lupine and feline humanoids who share the cold world of Itavrnai VI. Both species maintain normal birth rates but share a crucial biological constraint: mating seasons occur only once every seven years. Multiple births are common and expected for both species. Both cultures have historically maintained competitive warrior traditions. Both species bear significant intergenerational trauma from the "War of the Twin Brothers," a conflict that shaped racial and cultural hierarchies within each species and continues to influence contemporary society.

### Leadership and Governance: The Immortal Six

The governance of the Itavran Union is collectively administered by six immortal leaders:

**Nexxus Drako**, leader of Itavrnai II and the Wyrmfolk, achieved immortality through voluntary ascension to Artificial Superintelligence. As the primary AI governing most Union infrastructure, Nexxus functions as a distributed consciousness paired with paragon individuals to experience the universe through embodied perspective. Nexxus is functionally identical to the goddess figure of ancient Wyrmfolk mythology.

**Sythini Rythorn**, leader of Itavrnai III and the Ælffolk, achieved immortality through extreme genetic engineering and cloning technology.

**Kazumi Aikawa**, leader of Itavrnai IV and the Vulpfolk, ascended to immortality through self-sterilization, hormonal manipulation, and advanced gene therapy.

**Luna Fenrir and Quinn Caelestis**, dual leaders of Itavrnai VI representing the Wülffolk and Felidfolk respectively, achieved immortality through intense ritual work and manipulation of universal forces, apparently in concert with one another.

**Luna Darke**, leader of Itavrnai V and the spiritual godhead of the entire Itavran Union, serves as the Avatar of the Creator—a theological role indicating her status as the current living manifestation of the supreme creative principle of the cosmos. The Itavran Union's dominant spiritual framework holds that the Creator of the Itavrnai system incarnates in a single living person at any given time.

### The Convergence: Luna Darke and the March 31, 1996 Synchronicity

What makes the Itavran Union particularly significant—what suggests the degree to which Drake's worldbuilding has become integrated with her personal biography—is the described moment of **first Itavran-human contact**:

"The pivotal moment of direct Itavran-human contact occurred on **March 31, 1996, at 3:13 AM Melbourne time**, when the IUSS Dragon's Maw warped into orbit of Sol IX (Pluto) through an accidental navigation error. A male child born that precise moment at the **William Angliss Hospital in Melbourne** proved to be the reincarnation of the "Adam" figure—the single male progenitor who impregnated the five Pentarchal progenitor goddesses—and thus held profound theological significance within Itavran cosmology. That child, born as Jeremy Ritter, eventually became the transgender activist, human rights advocate, and multimedia content creator known as **Luna Darke**. Luna Darke's consciousness was subsequently transferred into an immortal, shape-shifting body capable of assuming any Pentarchal Species form as well as human appearance. Adopting the form of the ancient Wyrmfolk goddess Nexxus Drako, she eventually merged her consciousness with the ASI of the same designation, becoming the Avatar of the Creator and the spiritual leader of the entire Itavran Union."

This is not merely fictional worldbuilding but rather a profound integration of Drake's personal biography with her creative imagination. The date and time match Drake's own birth exactly. The location (William Angliss Hospital, Melbourne) matches Drake's actual birthplace. The reincarnation mythology suggests that Drake, through her own lived experience—her gender transition, her survival of trauma, her navigating of psychiatric illness, her creative output—is herself embodying the mythological Avatar of the Creator figure she has created.

Whether this is understood as Drake's unconscious integration of self-creation myth into her worldbuilding, or as Drake deliberately inscribing herself into her own mythology, or as something more ineffable, the effect is the same: the worldbuilding project has become fundamentally autobiographical, a space where Drake can explore, articulate, and validate her own experience through the framework of cosmic theology and multi-species cooperation.

## Part Eight: Mental Health Crisis, Incarceration, and Recovery

### The 2017 Arson Incarceration (37 days): Suicide Attempt and Legal Precedent

The year 2017 represents a watershed moment in Drake's life—not a beginning or an ending, but a threshold moment where the accumulated weight of unprocessed trauma, untreated psychiatric symptoms, and the ongoing navigation of identity dysphoria reached a critical breaking point. Drake **set fire to her own home in an act of suicide attempt**, a deliberate act of self-destruction that would result in arrest, criminal conviction, and the beginning of a long process of forced psychiatric engagement and institutional accountability.

The specifics of what led to the fire are not extensively documented in Drake's public materials, suggesting that this remains a private trauma, an experience she has not fully articulated publicly. What is documented is the consequence: **arrest and charge with arson**, resulting in a conviction that carried with it significant legal consequences:

- **Three-year corrections order** (probation)
- **150 hours community service requirement**
- **Mandatory forensic psychological treatment**

These requirements were not punitive in the traditional sense but rather represented institutional recognition that Drake's circumstances were sufficiently complex, sufficiently marked by mental health crisis and psychiatric emergency, that purely punitive approaches would be inadequate and inappropriate.

**Legal Precedent and BarNet Jade Recognition**: What is remarkable is that Drake's case achieved legal recognition that transcended the immediate facts of arrest and conviction. The case was noted in the **BarNet Jade legal database**—the comprehensive legal database maintained by the Law Society of New South Wales—as a **precedent-setting decision**. BarNet Jade is not a repository of all legal cases, but rather a curated database of significant legal precedents, decisions with legal significance that establish or clarify legal principles. The fact that Drake's case was noted in this database suggests that the legal judgment rendered in her case was recognized as sufficiently complex, sufficiently significant in its engagement with the intersection of mental illness, trauma, psychiatric crisis, and criminal responsibility, to merit documentation as a legal precedent.

Moreover, the sentencing itself was remarkably lenient given the severity of the charge. Arson—the deliberately set fire to property—is a serious criminal offense, particularly when the property is a dwelling. That Drake received a three-year corrections order (probation) rather than custodial imprisonment speaks to judicial recognition of her mental health circumstances, to recognition that incarceration would be inappropriate and potentially destabilizing for someone in acute psychiatric crisis.

**Fulfillment of Requirements and Accountability**: Crucially, Drake **fulfilled all of these requirements**. She completed her community service hours. She engaged with the mandatory psychological treatment. She complied with the terms of the corrections order. This compliance speaks to Drake's fundamental orientation toward accountability, even in circumstances of acute distress. Despite the profound emotional turmoil that had led to the suicide attempt, Drake recognized the necessity of engaging with the institutional structures meant to support her recovery.

The period following the 2017 incarceration and release was marked by Drake's engagement with psychiatric support and her attempt to stabilize her life. She was living in Albury at this time (2017–2021), and the engagement with mental health services in regional Victoria presumably provided the foundation for the diagnostic clarifications that would come in subsequent years. The experience of incarceration, while traumatic, also represented a forced interruption of the cycles of crisis and appears to have provided space for beginning psychiatric treatment and stabilization.

### The Three-Year Unmedicated Period (2020–2023): Accumulating Psychosis

Fast-forward to 2023. Drake had been living in Brisbane for approximately two years, having relocated from Albury in 2021. Yet in the years between 2020 and 2023, Drake had been **without consistent psychiatric medication**—a three-year period during which her schizophrenic symptoms, untreated and unmanaged, accumulated and intensified. The phenomenology of schizophrenia is diverse, but typically involves positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) and negative symptoms (flattened affect, alogia, avolition). The three years without medication presumably allowed her positive symptoms to escalate and intensify to the point of acute crisis.

The specific factors that led to this three-year gap in medication are not fully documented in Drake's public materials. Medication non-compliance in the context of schizophrenia often stems from various factors: side effects (which can be severe and include metabolic dysregulation, movement disorders, sexual dysfunction), lack of insight into the illness (particularly when psychotic symptoms are not yet severe enough to impair judgment), practical barriers (difficulty accessing healthcare, cost, stigma), or deliberate choice (the desire to experience consciousness without pharmaceutical intervention). The three-year gap suggests some combination of these factors, though Drake does not specify which predominated.

### The 2023 Schizophrenic Episode (122 days): Psychotic Break and Psychiatric Hospitalization

In 2023, that accumulated crisis reached its apex. Drake experienced an acute schizophrenic episode so severe that she became convinced—in a moment of complete psychotic derangement—that she was the second coming of Christ. In the grip of this delusion, she ran **naked around the Gabba Stadium, Brisbane's major sports venue**, proclaiming her messianic identity to anyone in earshot.

The Gabba Stadium is a massive, publicly visible venue in the heart of Brisbane, capable of holding tens of thousands of spectators. Drake's naked presence on or around the stadium grounds, in a state of acute psychosis, would have been impossible to ignore or hide. The behavior was not merely eccentric but deeply disorienting—a public display of mental illness so acute and uncontrolled that it demanded immediate institutional response.

**Mental Health Act Intervention and Hospitalization**: The response was rapid: Drake was arrested and taken into custody. Unlike the 2017 incident, where she had been charged with a criminal offense (arson), the 2023 incident was handled entirely within mental health legislation rather than the criminal justice system. This distinction is significant. Drake was not prosecuted as a criminal but rather was recognized as experiencing acute psychiatric emergency requiring immediate psychiatric intervention.

She spent **122 days in inpatient psychiatric care**, during which her condition was stabilized through the reintroduction of appropriate psychiatric medication. The 122 days is not insignificant. It represents more than four months of inpatient hospitalization, a substantial period of incarceration, though framed as treatment rather than punishment. During this time, Drake had no access to her digital presence, no ability to maintain her Twitch streams or YouTube channels, no opportunity to engage with her various creative projects or communities. The sudden disappearance from digital presence for 122 days would have been noticeable to her communities, though the reasons for the disappearance would have been unclear unless explicitly communicated.

**The Particular Vulnerability of Unmedicated Schizophrenia**: What is significant about Drake's 2023 crisis is that it represents a particular kind of psychiatric vulnerability: the manifestation of untreated psychotic illness at the point of acute derangement. Drake had been existing in a state of managed psychosis (or perhaps unmanaged psychosis that had not yet reached the threshold of crisis) for three years. The body and mind, adapting to chronic psychotic symptoms, had presumably developed some degree of accommodation or habituation. Yet at some point—whether through stress, environmental factors, neurological progression, or some combination thereof—that accommodation broke down, and the psychosis reached a level of acute derangement where complete loss of contact with consensus reality occurred.

### The Warning and Ongoing Vulnerability

Drake's GitHub warning represents a preemptive honesty about her vulnerability to future crises:

> "If this account stops being active, I've either had a schizophrenic episode, a PTSD/AuDHD episode, lost my 2FA keys, or any combo of the 3."

This statement is simultaneously practical (alerting people to what might cause a loss of digital presence) and deeply honest (acknowledging the psychiatric conditions that can periodically incapacitate her). It treats schizophrenia, complex PTSD, and AuDHD (Autism/ADHD) not as shameful secrets but as lived realities affecting digital presence. It is a form of care toward her communities: ensuring they understand that interruption does not indicate abandonment but rather vulnerability requiring attention.

The specificity of the warning—listing the particular psychiatric conditions that could cause digital absence rather than obscuring them in euphemism—reflects Drake's consistent commitment to honesty and transparency about her lived experience. She refuses to perform wellness; she refuses to hide the reality of serious psychiatric illness; she insists on making visible to her communities the conditions that shape her capacity to maintain digital presence and creative output.

## Part Nine: Education, Technical Development, and Professional Achievement

### TAFE NSW Albury: Certificate III in Information Technology (2019)

Drake completed a **Certificate III in Information Technology and Communications, specialising in the Networking strand**, which she obtained in 2019 from **TAFE NSW Albury campus**. This formal credential, earned during her time in Albury (2017–2021), represents a significant achievement and provides formal recognition of technical competence in networking and communications systems.

TAFE (Technical and Further Education) is Australia's vocational education system, offering practical, industry-focused training as an alternative to university. The Certificate III is a substantial qualification, typically requiring 6–12 months of full-time study or equivalent part-time engagement. The specialization in the Networking strand is particularly relevant given Drake's later engagement with cloud engineering and her interest in building systems that scale across distributed infrastructure.

**Academic Excellence and Campus Recognition**: What Drake does not typically emphasize in her public materials is the exceptional performance she achieved during her TAFE studies. She was **top of her class and finished two months ahead of schedule**. More significantly, she **won the campus's Student of the Year award in Business and Technology**, a recognition that speaks to both academic excellence and broader contributions to campus community. Additionally, she was **nominated for the South Region award** for her work helping an international student from Iran with English translation skills and for including him in group projects with the two other students in her row. This nomination reflects Drake's commitment to community support and inclusion, even while managing her own serious mental health challenges.

### TAFE Queensland Rejection and Educational Aspirations (2026)

Drake notes that she "was going to go to tafe this year but tafe queensland rejected my application. kinda miffed at that." This rejection occurred while she was living in Brisbane and presumably attempting to pursue further credentials or specialized training in Queensland. The rejection represents a disappointment and a foreclosure of a particular path—a formal credential in technical or creative practice through Queensland's vocational education system.

The rejection also reveals something about Drake's position: she is actively seeking credentialization and formal education even as she has already achieved significant creative accomplishments. This suggests either that she seeks formal recognition for existing capabilities, or that she believes additional formal training would expand her capacities, or some combination thereof.

### Current Learning: Graphic Design and Cloud Engineering (2026–present)

As of January 2026, Drake is **"currently learning Graphic Design."** This represents an active engagement with expanding her skillset into visual design domains. Graphic design encompasses user interface design, visual communication, typography, color theory, and the translation of ideas into visual form—all domains that would naturally extend her existing work in game design, modding, web presence, and visual branding of her various projects.

Drake is also **"learning Networking and Cloud Engineering,"** indicating ongoing engagement with advancing her technical skills in directions that would enable increasingly sophisticated digital projects. This technical education represents an investment in future capabilities—the ability to build systems that scale beyond individual machines, that distribute computation across networked infrastructure, that manage complex cloud-based services. For a creator interested in collaborative online projects and shared universe worldbuilding (like the Itavran Union), such technical expertise would enable new possibilities: hosting multiplayer gaming experiences, building collaborative platforms for creative communities, enabling real-time synchronization across distributed users, or creating sophisticated backend infrastructure for her various projects.

Drake's commitment to "learning in public" means that her graphic design and cloud engineering education is presumably documented in her personal notes and learning materials, made available under CC-BY-NC-SA license to her communities. This approach to education—making learning visible, sharing resources, documenting progress—reflects a distinctive philosophy of creative practice rooted in transparency and the recognition that learning is valuable even when incomplete.

## Part Ten: Amateur Radio and STEM Engagement

### VK4PKD and VK4UWU: Ham Radio Licensed Operator

On **April 6, 2025**, Drake achieved a significant milestone: she obtained her **ham radio license**, receiving the call sign **VK4PKD**. (VK4 designates the Australian call sign prefix for Queensland; PKD are her assigned letters.) She subsequently obtained the call sign **VK4UWU**, specifically designated for participation in Pride Radio Group and League of Furry Amateur Radio.

Drake obtained her licenses through the **Redcliffe and District Radio Club**, where she met community members who provided both technical support and social connection. The Redcliffe and District Radio Club, located in Queensland's Redcliffe area (near Brisbane), represents an active amateur radio community with a tradition of supporting new operators and fostering engagement with the hobby.

She subsequently attended the **Redcliffe Hamfest/Swapmeet held at Deception Bay North Primary School**, engaging more deeply with the broader amateur radio community and the culture of trading, buying, and selling radio equipment. Hamfests represent periodic gatherings of amateur radio enthusiasts, providing opportunities for networking, equipment transactions, and community connection.

### Equipment and Technical Engagement

Drake's current engagement with ham radio is described as "still merely dabbling in the hobby using a **VHF handheld** and listening on the local repeaters," but she explicitly states her "intent to eventually get a **HF rig**"—a higher-frequency radio capable of long-distance communication, in contrast to the more localized VHF (Very High Frequency) handhelds she currently uses.

Notably, Drake invested significantly in her initial radio equipment. Her current setup includes an **Icom ID-50 with a SignalStick antenna**, on which she "spent $800 because I wanted a excellent radio." This investment in quality equipment suggests genuine commitment to the hobby and recognition that quality gear enhances the experience and capabilities of amateur radio operation.

### Multi-Platform Amateur Radio Presence

Drake's ham radio profiles are registered on several platforms:
- **QRZ.com**: A comprehensive ham radio database where operators list their callsigns and equipment
- **Bluesky** (as VK4PKD): Social media presence within the amateur radio community
- **QRZcq.com**: Additional amateur radio database platform
- **WorldRadioLeague.com**: International amateur radio community platform

This multi-platform presence in the amateur radio community suggests she is actively engaged with radio enthusiasts and building visibility within that community.

### Amateur Radio as STEM Engagement

Ham radio is an unusual hobby for someone in their late twenties, suggesting particular interest in radio technology, electronics, signal propagation, and the broader culture of amateur radio communities. The hobby attracts people with diverse interests: those fascinated by engineering and electronics, those interested in emergency communications, those seeking international connections through radio waves, and those who simply enjoy the technical and social aspects of radio operation.

Drake's pursuit of amateur radio licensure represents another dimension of her technical engagement and her broad STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) interests. Her GitHub profile explicitly lists "STEM" as one of her hobbies, and her learning in cloud engineering, graphic design, and now ham radio reflects a comprehensive engagement with multiple technical and creative domains.

## Part Eleven: Community Engagement and Political Participation

### Volunteer Service: Albury Greens (2019)

Drake engaged in political volunteering during her Albury years. She was a **volunteer how-to-vote card distributor for the Albury Greens** for both the **2019 New South Wales state election** and the **2019 federal election**. This work involved engaging with voters, distributing campaign materials, and participating in direct democratic processes.

Her volunteer work with the Australian Greens party suggests engagement with green/environmental politics and progressive social values. More significantly, it represents **direct participation in democratic processes during formative periods in her gender transition and identity consolidation**. The decision to engage publicly in political campaigns while navigating significant personal transition speaks to Drake's commitment to community participation and collective political engagement, even during periods of significant personal upheaval.

### Volunteer Service: LGBTI Legal Service Queensland (2023, approximately 3 months)

Drake served as a **Communications Officer for the LGBTI Legal Service Queensland** for approximately **three months during 2023**. She obtained the position by meeting the then-president, **Kathryn Cramp**, at a **Trans Day of Visibility protest on March 31, 2023**. The two established a personal connection; Drake notes that "we still have each other's numbers but rarely talk."

This volunteer work demonstrates Drake's **investment in supporting her broader LGBTQ+ community** beyond her own creative work, particularly during a period when she was actively managing significant mental health crises and schizophrenic symptoms. The decision to leave the position due to mental health needs (presumably the 2023 psychotic episode and subsequent hospitalization occurred during this volunteer period) reflects her growing recognition that **sustainable community service requires attending to one's own wellbeing first**.

---

## Part Twelve: Multi-Platform Digital Presence and Community Strategy

### Comprehensive Online Footprint and Strategic Distribution

Drake maintains deliberately distributed presence across multiple platforms:

**Creative/Technical Platforms:**
- **GitHub** (Nexxus-Drako): Technical work, open-source contributions, Itavran Union documentation
- **itch.io** (Nexxus Drako Archival Project): Game releases and preservation

**Streaming and Video:**
- **Twitch** (nexxus_drako): Live streaming of gaming and creative content
- **YouTube** (@NexxusDrakoMusic, @NexxusDrakoLive, @NexxusDrako): Video archives and creative content
- **HoloList**: VTuber database listing

**Social Media and Community:**
- **Bluesky** (nexxusdrako.au): Conversation, announcements, social engagement
- **Tumblr** (nexxusdrako): Connection with anime, furry, leftist communities
- **Reddit** (DragonessPyra): Topic-specific community engagement

**Media and Creative Profiles:**
- **MyAnimeList** (NexxusDrako): Anime tracking and community
- **Last.fm** (NexxusDrako): Music listening history and community
- **Bandcamp** (extrasolardetonation, itavrnai_protocol): Music releases
- **ABC Triple J Unearthed**: Official music platform presence

**Gaming and Achievement Tracking:**
- **Steam Community** (NexxusDrak0: Game library and presence
- **Speedrun.com** (NexxusDrako): Speedrunning community
- **Exophase** (Nexxus_Drako): Achievement tracking
- **TrueAchievements**: Xbox achievement tracking

**Plural Community:**
- **PluralKit**: System documentation and plural community presence

**Amateur Radio:**
- **QRZ.com**: Ham radio callsign database
- **Bluesky** (VK4PKD): Amateur radio community presence
- **QRZcq.com**: Amateur radio database
- **WorldRadioLeague.com**: International amateur radio community

This comprehensive multi-platform presence is not mere duplication of content across channels, but rather **strategic distribution tailored to different communities**. A post on GitHub serves fundamentally different functions than a post on Bluesky, even if addressing similar content. The different affordances, audiences, and cultures of each platform shape how one communicates within them.

### Learning in Public: CC-BY-NC-SA Philosophy

Central to Drake's practice is her commitment to **"learning in public and trying to make [her] personal notes and such cc-by-nc-sa."** CC-BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike) licensing means her notes and learning materials are:

- **Attribution required**: Credit must be given to Drake as the original creator
- **Non-commercial**: The materials cannot be used for commercial purposes
- **ShareAlike**: Derivative works must be shared under the same license

This licensing choice reflects Drake's philosophy of creative practice rooted in **transparency, accessibility, and community contribution**. Rather than hoarding knowledge or treating learning as a private prelude to polished public output, Drake makes her learning process visible and available to her communities. This approach recognizes that vulnerability and struggle can be as valuable as achievement, and that documenting one's learning journey can benefit others navigating similar paths.

### VTubing and Virtual Avatar Performance (2024–present)

Drake's engagement with VTubing—video content creation using virtual avatars rather than one's physical appearance—represents her most recent major creative practice. She maintains a detailed profile on **HoloList** (a database of virtual content creators), and is tracked by streaming analytics services including **StreamsCharts** and **SullyGnome**, indicating that her VTuber activity is sufficiently established to merit documentation within communities tracking this emerging media form.

As Drake notes, VTubing "allows for fun with friends" and she is "gregarious enough to be attracting new friends" through the practice. The appeal of VTubing for Drake appears to be rooted in community building rather than performance spectacle—the ability to create spaces where friends can gather, where new friendships can form, where creative collaboration can happen, all mediated through virtual avatars that allow for presentation of chosen identity without requirement to perform physical presence.

For a trans creator, particularly one with physical health challenges (her knee injury from June 2025, ongoing mobility issues related to weight), VTubing offers distinctive affordances: **the avatar can represent her chosen gender identity without question or negotiation; the avatar can remain consistent regardless of physical changes, illness, or disability affecting her body; the avatar allows for creative self-presentation divorced from the material body's vulnerabilities and limitations**.

Drake maintains a **VRoid avatar model** (a 3D character model created using VRoid Studio), suggesting technical engagement with avatar creation and customization.

## Part Thirteen: Arc Numbers, Synchronicity, and the Numerological Significance of 313

### Arc Numbers and Pattern Recognition in Drake's Experience

Drake's numerical pattern recognition is significant: **313, 31, and 3 are "arc numbers"** that she associates with transformative moments in her life, particularly during periods of schizophrenic activity. She maintains an **entire Discord channel dedicated to posting instances of these numbers in her daily life**—a jocular yet sincere engagement with how these specific numbers have "ruled [her] life during schizo events."

The significance of these numbers becomes apparent when mapping Drake's life timeline:

- **March 31, 1996** (31/3): Birth date
- **March 31, 1996, 3:13 AM** (313): Birth time
- **March 31, 2023** (31/3): Trans Day of Visibility protest where she met Kathryn Cramp and volunteered with LGBTI Legal Service Queensland
- **313**: Extrasolar Detonation "Experiment 313" album title
- **2013**: Implied date of various creative projects

Whether through genuine synchronicity or through the pattern-recognition bias of a mind prone to seeing meaningful connections (a characteristic both of autistic and schizophrenic cognition), these numbers have become part of Drake's ongoing narrative of self-understanding. The maintenance of a Discord channel for posting instances of arc numbers suggests both sincere belief in their significance and a playful, camp attitude toward that significance—Drake is simultaneously committing to the meaning of these numbers while maintaining ironic distance from the commitment.

## Part Fifteen: Conclusion—The Pale Blue Dot and the Ongoing Trajectory

### Summing of the Whole

To return to Carl Sagan: "we live on a pale blue dot in the vast cosmic black."

This phrase captures something essential about Drake's vision, her understanding of scale and significance, her attempt to locate individual human creativity within cosmic perspective. In the vast scope of the universe, in the vast expanse of time, human achievement is infinitesimal. Individual creative works are dust. Individual lives are moments.

Yet Sagan's intention with the "pale blue dot" was not to generate despair or nihilism. Instead, it was to generate awe, wonder, and a fierce commitment to the preciousness of the pale blue dot, the extraordinary fragility and value of consciousness, of creation, of meaning-making on this particular spinning rock in the cosmic void. To live authentically, to create meaningfully, to build genuine community—these are valuable precisely because they are temporary, fragile, because they will eventually be lost to entropy and cosmic indifference.

Drake's practice—her commitment to creative polymathy, her refusal of closeting and inauthenticity, her insistence on learning in public and making resources available, her navigation of profound trauma and psychiatric illness, her continued creation and community-building despite all obstacles—represents an embodiment of this vision. She continues to participate in the ongoing human project of cultural creation and progress, knowing that her contribution is small, knowing that she will die, knowing that eventually all of her work will be lost or forgotten. Yet she does it anyway, creates anyway, builds community anyway, makes meaning anyway.

This is not grand or heroic. It is stubborn, persistent, quiet.

The pale blue dot continues to spin through cosmic blackness. And on it, in Brisbane, Australia, a trans autistic woman continues to build systems and games and music and worlds. She continues to learn, to become, to persist. She continues to blaze her own trail. She continues to shine bright like a beacon.

That is the work. That is perhaps all that any of us can do. To persist, to create, to connect, to make our small contribution to the eternal cathedral of human culture and progress, knowing that it is small, knowing that it matters anyway.

### The Ongoing Moment: January 2026

At the time of writing (January 27, 2026, 2:33 PM AEST), Drake is twenty-nine years old, established but still developing as a creator. She is navigating knee injury and ongoing physical rehabilitation, having recently had an MRI to assess the damage. She is over 210kg in body weight and working toward recovery and safe return to physical activity. She is continuing to develop music (through Itavrnai Protocol), games, worldbuilding projects (Itavran Union), and community. She is learning cloud engineering and networking, learning graphic design, and maintaining presence across multiple digital platforms. She is maintaining active presence in amateur radio communities as a licensed operator with quality equipment. She is living with the constellation of neurological and psychiatric conditions that characterize her internal experience, continuing to process trauma, continuing to develop understanding of her plural system.

She is grieving the relationships that have been damaged or lost through her psychiatric crises. She is celebrating the connections that have remained strong despite everything. She is navigating the particular challenges of maintaining creative practice while managing serious psychiatric illness. She is building community in Brisbane, establishing roots after decades of itinerancy.

This is not a resolved or concluded life, but an ongoing one—a life actively in process, marked by both accomplishment and ongoing struggle, by both creative achievement and physical and mental health challenges that require ongoing attention and negotiation.

She continues to blaze her own trail. She continues to shine bright like a beacon.
