# Administrators Log - 10:45 Local

So I spent most of the morning playing video games with my friends on Discord. I have to say that went reasonably well. Now I'm at a point where I've been doing administrative updates to my music project and my website for a few hours now. My worker is about 15 minutes late, but it is what it is.

I ended up uploading New Signal to Triple J unleashed and the Atomic Music Space again. And I also did some changes to the website, particularly the archive project, as well as minor changes to the GitHub profile, as well as setting up the GitHub backup for my Obsidian notes.

Still pulled on all-nighter on caffeine, and went unmedicated nearly a whole weekend, so that's not necessarily a good thing. I blame Sega Football Club Champions to be quite honest with you, that game is hyper-addictive and very very gacha. 

Hopefully I've got the MCO worked out for that and we don't have to move anyone on for quite some time at this point, but who knows? There could be more inactivity, and there could be people that don't make it to Division 5 in the World Premiership, so there's that.

Other than that, I'm hoping to at least get some groceries done today, but we'll have to see about that. I'm technically a dollar or so overdrawn due to international transaction fees that caught up to me that I completely forgot about. Still, it could be worse, I could be in debt to Jay again. And worse still, I could be in debt to those fucking BNPL companies, but I got out of that whole mire so don't need to go back.

Anyway, I think my worker has just arrived 20 minutes late, so I'm going to end this log here and I'll get back to this once I'm done shopping and my worker has left.
